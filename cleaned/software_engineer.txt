these requirements were far beyond the package we had at the time and we needed a fast turnaround and a good price in order for our bid to remain competitivewe contacted several different insurance brokers all of whom took either an inordinate amount of time to give back results or began quoting prices in excess of twice of what i expected the costs to beolivier was contacted two days before the

bill worked with michael in the same group bill is an excellent developer i have over 12 years experience and consider myself a guru and was astonished how we always came to the same conclusions and hand the same mindset not only that bill not only exceeds myself in dealing with customer support he also exceeds in documentation which is a major part of the full life cycle of development yet another asset of bill is he is very easy to work with which in turn he works well in team environments in conclusion bill has been around the block and would be the person who knows answers for

the maturity to seek clarity in requirements but he also has a sense of ownership and will push back when he sees a better way for the business however once heard tim commit to the businesss

enhance types with arbitrary executable predicates so that any semidecidable specification may be written as a type in my dissertationwhich expands considerably on my ms thesis i provide the theoretical machinery to work with these types and implementation approaches to make their implementation feasible of particular interest is the fact that type checking is undecidable so i introduce many new techniques for reasoning about and implementing undecidable type systemsi show how to enforce an undecidable type system by blending static and dynamic checking in a technique dubbed hybrid type checking then i show that one may still omit all type annotations and the compiler can fill them in with the strongest candidate types possible then at run time every dynamic assertion failure feeds back into the static type system so every crash occurs at most once see less see less about university of california santa cruz doctor of philosophy phd university of oregon field of study

softball things over the plate with atm and not expect him to drive it out of the park even a curve ball rarely gets by him simply put working next to atm means that you have to bring your a game not only in your own work to live up to his shining example of productivity and elegant code you have to do it while sparring with him mentally he keeps you sharp on your toes as much as this

is extremely articulate and a fantastic communicator there are few people i would rather engage in technical discussion with or receive technical communication fromas long as i have known him dan has always maintained an admirable worklife balance his impact on the people around him is not only positive professionally but culturally as welli honestly hope to have the pleasure of working with him

given 1 rashi agarwal technical manager march 26 2017 nora worked with rashi in the same group one of nora’s strongest qualities is her ability to take initiative and lead even in difficult situations as part of the relatively small tools and productivity team at jet nora had not only stepped up to take the lead on development of the tools but had also been instrumental in evangelizing and gaining traction on the tooling with all the technology teams at jet her technical creativity ability to form relationships and communicate product vision to others is extremely valuable in delivering an idea from inception to adoption she also takes an active interest in helping her colleagues cultivate their professional goals such as learning new technologies or participating in conferences having gained a lot of experience herself on that front nora is an asset to any team and i would love to work with her again rahul ratnagiri software engineer at jetcom march 19 2017 rahul reported directly to nora i would like to recommend nora because she is one of the most complete engineers i have worked with nora is a highly skilled software developer while also an excellent delegate for crossteam negotiations she is highly motivated smart and very talented when i joined jets internal tools and productivity team under noras supervision her roles ranged from handling multiple development projects to meeting with third party software companies for deciding the best productivity and testing tools to use internally and to evangelize our tools to developer teams i have seen her handle all the different roles effectively while also taking up initiatives like chaos testing and purple friday games gamifying developer teams preparation for purple friday nora has a true knack for mentorship her style of guiding rather than instructing encouraged me to think and work independently shadowing her into meetings and discussing the outcomes with her later i gathered a lot of domain knowledge i also enjoyed code and design reviews with nora for her ideas opinions and questions i am grateful to have had the chance to work with nora and learn from her i would love to work with her again view 8 more recommendations view 8 more recommendations recommendations cody mack senior software engineer at jetcom april 13 2017 nora worked with cody in different groups i had the pleasure of working with cody over the past year and a half cody was the designated expert on countless topics and if he wasnt the expert  he was likely about to be pulled into the project to give his opinion while he was a fantastic engineer he was also a wonderful colleague on a personal level always willing to help train someone new or give advice on a subject i found cody to be a great mentor to me when i started at the company and he was easily someone i would solicit for technical advice throughout my tenure  whether it was hearing out an idea or poking holes in an architecture cody could advise on it within no time at all my favorite project was when cody and i got to partner on an effort that would drive the availability of the jet platform up across all teams cody had a tooling prototype built within a day to make this effort a reality and helped technically advise the project throughout the next year i’m excited to see all the things that cody accomplishes in his already commendable career and would welcome the chance to work with him again accomplishments nora has 1 certification 1 expand certifications section certification google analytics individual qualification gaiq nora has 1 honor 1

science what had inspired me to study computer science was a pixar talk i attended as a high schooler i was amazed at what could be accomplished with computer graphics and the way that pixar uses new technology to tell a story perhaps much better than anyone ever could at university i joined the ubc imager graphics lab and became part of many computer graphics related research projects one of my fondest memories was attending siggraph 2013 in anaheim when im not coding i like to design and sew my own clothes making things with my hands is very therapeutic to me and has always been my passion

on her technical prowess so ill instead focus on how much she contributed to my internship experience as this was my first foray into industry i was slightly apprehensive of working and contributing to a real world product but janelle not only was extraordinarily helpful in teaching me code conventions and techniques but also was incredibly welcoming and considerate there were countless timeless times i had some bug or question and she continually helped me quickly and thoughtfully her patience was endless and her answers went straight to the heart of the issue and consistently helped me resolve the problem she was a great leader and a thoughtful teacher deborah van dam entrepreneurial digital communications and marketing manager june 5 2013 janelle worked with deborah in the same group janelle and i worked closely to build crowdjewel dba shopbevel building a company requires enormous dedication patience and tenacity and though janelle was challenged on a number of fronts she was able to adapt and succeed first she had to take over an unfinished product and not only had to make it work but also make it attractive and intuitive janelle worked overtime while working on her ms to learn how to build out the site in time for pitching second crowdjewel was in a space that she is not familiar with jewelryfashion ecommerce janelle immersed herself in this industry and was able to interact naturally with customers as needed third she was challenged interpersonally we had to work very quickly with a range of personalities compounded with the stress of working nonstop janelle handled herself appropriately and professionally at all times and maintained a sunny disposition that helped keep spirits up as a result janelles contributions were critical to our teams

recommendations received 3 given 3 emery wang software engineer september 5 2014 daniel worked with emery in the same group as a former colleague who worked with daniel for 2 years daniels easygoing demeanor and strong work ethic has made him a terrific coworker and a pleasure to work with aside from being an outstanding team player daniels enthusiasm in keeping up with the latest cutting edge technology also makes him a great person to talk to and learn about all the emerging trends in the software industry id highly recommend daniel to any technology company that needs an outstanding contributor and strives to stay on top of the game with the latest and greatest technology danzhou liu mts at netapp march 31 2014 daniel worked with danzhou in the same group i worked with daniel for about 2 years at symantec daniels deep knowledge of algorithms and data structures his ability to translate ideas into code quickly and above all his singleminded dedication to the project were vital for keeping our work on schedule he is a valuable asset for the team i would not hesitate to recommend daniel for any position in storage software engineering view 1 more recommendation view 1 more recommendation recommendations emery wang software engineer september 9 2014 emery worked with daniel in the same group i worked directly with emery for more than two years as a peer at symanteci believe there are two kinds of great coworkers adders and multipliers adders do their own work well but multipliers enable every other team member to do better work emery wang is the textbook example of a multiplier with him onboard the entire team is able to work far more effectively the best example of emerys multiplier effect was on a challenging project in which engineers required highend storage arrays and servers there was never enough equipment for team members to get their development and test tasks done leading to many weeks of frustrating wasted time emery took charge of the situation and organized the hardware into complete clusters that could be reserved on a pertask basis arranged for nonfunctioning systems to get fixed and installed and presented a successful case to upper management that purchasing more equipment would be necessary in order for the project to be successful in the end emery was effectively managing more than 10 million of lab equipment in three countries all on top of his ordinary software development duties emery identified a problem took the initiative and fixed it saving the other members of his team thousands of hours of wasted time emery was a key asset for symantec as a whole and i am proud to have worked with him he would be a fantastic contributor and multiplier on any software development team sarb singhkaur software development executive leader june 27 2013 daniel reported directly to sarb sarb brings out the very best in his employees he pushes each and every one of us to excel at our work master our problem areas and act with confidence he is the only manager who can seamlessly go from discussing the minutiae of a deep technical problem to giving an inspirational pep talk for the whole team thanks to

keeps a bigger picture in mind and this allows him to look at the problem at hand from different perspectives often resulting in original solutions tad is not only an exceptional manager but also a prolific developer he can successfully juggle many activities at the same time including team management design writing specifications implementation debugging code review and many others when tad got interested in functional programming haskell he also convinced the entire team to attend his class in order to expand the mind and it did  at least for me i would welcome an opportunity to work with

foundation and at wso2 i am more than happy to recommend ajith as a highly motivated and passionate researcher software engineer who can solve “really” tough technical challenges with his deep technical expertisehe is a team player and at the same time a gogetter that you can offload any tough challenging work just to give a hint at lsf we about 6 people worked on a project to completely redesign apache’s web services engine axis and one of the key challenges in this project was to provide an object model for the soap messages handled by the engine with streaming stax friendly manner we had an interesting discussion on what need to be done not how it can be done in one of the days the next day ajith came bit late to work but he had a working prototype of the object model in his laptop this project later becomes a separate apache project on its own named axiom i highly recommend ajith to any organization with tough technical challenges amila navarathna director at deloitte

but at different companies ive had to upgrade our product to use a much newer version of silverlining as well as to implement new functionality including support for geocentric databases having never worked with silverlining i contacted frank kane at sundog software with a number of silverlining sdk implementation questions all of my requests for help were quickly addressed and his answers very accurately diagnosed my issues and resolved my problems he really saved me a lot of time and effort ive worked with a number of 3rd party vendors over the years and have rarely received the high level of support that frank has provided i highly recommend frank len granowetter vice president products division at mak technologies january 27 2013 len was a client of frank’s working with frank has been a great experience he has demonstrated deep expertise in 3d graphics and shader techniques great judgement in trading off performance flexibility and implementation cost terrific communication skills and the rare ability to jump into an unfamiliar code base and start contributing value immediately hes equally comfortable working with engineers on lowlevel technical details and discussing toplevel design and strategy with technical and business decisionmakers hes also a genuinely nice guy whos been very easy to work with id recommend frank for just about anything view 2 more recommendations

for identifying your values and goals never before have i encountered an exercise that is both so simple and so profound in the actionable insights it gives you within just a few minutes jocelyns process hit me with an aha moment like a ton of bricks were talking lifechanging stuff and youre hearing this from someone who approaches selfimprovement exercises with deep skepticism in my case things that are deeply important to my own success were going unaddressed and even actively ignored  and i never even realized it shes on to something that deserves to be shared more widely chen
