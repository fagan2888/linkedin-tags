miss his input on our project thomas w hillman data engineer  utility fielder august 2 2013 thomas w worked with chuchi but at different companies i worked with chuchi as a subcontractor on a very important government program this program has very high visibility within the larger organization and is critical to the work they do chuchi came in as a newbie to our customer but quickly took stock of the situation and set to work getting us the traction we were sorely lackingchuchi has strong leadership and analyst skills and he was able not only to get us better organized but he was able to get the customers to open up with what their real requirements were using a combination of agile techniques and the triedtrue waterfall sdlcs we were able to produce a product that not only met the customers needs but was considered so important that the government sponsor pleaded with his management not to defund us they actually gave us more moneychuchi was also able to make a solid business case for adding ftes to the contract something that in the government environment is hard to do unless you can develop a compelling business case which chuchi did we were able to add two additional ftes to the project and was able to backfill any position that came openas team members chuchi gave us general direction but trusted us to make wise use of our time and allowed us to experiment with different ideas for solving an issue but always keeping an eye out for overreaching and requirements creep chuchi also encouraged us to go beyond our position descriptions and to explore other areas on the project that were interest to us and expanded our skillsi believe the quality and length of the other recommendations speaks to chuchis skills both as a technologist and as a businessman and leader there is not much more i could addin closing i would just like to say that i would work with chuchi again and when i am in a position of leadership will definitely seek him out as a trusted

help the team understand how to implement the model but in his time with k2 graham did so much more he broke down the model to each of its elements and then spent the time building it better and with more accuracy than was done in the past graham become not just our behind the scenes guru but also a trusted advisor for our client in making major model changes this level of trust that the client

may 2008 when govind first began working there he was assigned the task of helping me maintain a large historical option price database in sql this database is populated across 3 countryspecific platforms via multiple cronjobs by applications written in c c and perl his first priority was to ensure that the databases population was successful and if not to debug into the code and log files to address the problem as he progressed in his work he was given additional responsibilities which include loganalysis of our automated trading systems as well as testing and implementing a new theoretical volatility model govind has been successful in all the projects that he has worked on for our team he has been a major asset in his role as a financial intern while he is finishing up his graduate degree it was clear from the start that govind was very ambitious and was up for any challenge not only does he do the work that is asked of him in a timely fashion but he also goes a step beyond and suggests new ideas or ways of improving the current system that being said he also realizes his place within a team structure and is highly respectful of his superiors his programming skills are efficient and i am impressed by his desire to understand all of the details and quirks of any new programming language he learns for instance he learned perl while working here govind is

demonstrated very good programming skills and his main responsibility is helping one of our financial engineers with maintenance and improvement of our fe database which has become noticeably more reliable now in addition to that govind has been also working on a couple of research projects he is making a good progress and i plan to use his research in our trading algorithms one project is

was an engineer myself so i think i know what it takes to be a good one in my opinion it is not only following or accomplishing the product specifications correctly which alex did an excellent job in it is understanding the spirit of the product specifications what it does why it does it and how it fits within the greater product offering alex did not have a financial background but he quickly started to understand the financial aspects of the projects we were implementing and they were quite complex for example creating a multibucket framework to model credit transitions refactoring a prepayment model architecture that was inherited from a previous software engineer expanding the us agency prepayment model into international markets by creating additional classes that accepted additional components working with vendors to modify the data we pass from intex to their model from structures to pointers working on a distributed architecture and bulk loading schemes that improved performance by more than 60i would also like to add that in all those projects alex worked with our quality assurance team proactively and made sure that his changes impact was understood and well

opportunity to further his skills and understanding as just one example he has stayed late at work in order to get more experience with the software to which his project applies the error message project has benefitted significantly from tim’s experience with c and knowledge of quantitative finance in working on the project he went well beyond the basic requirements of his assignments and his perseverance in bringing to light potential issues and seeking out as many answers as needed to ensure clarity have been instrumental to the quality of the project furthermore i am sure we would not

hope the conference participants will be able to swing by the poster to take a look the abstract to our project can be found below we study the relationship between aggressiveness and survival under the context of retail entry using a dynamic game of entry we show numerically that the relationship between an incumbent aggressiveness and survival can either be positive or negative while aggressive entry can help an incumbent survive in the longrun it may also be harmful to the incumbent if the entrant is too strong with the same modeling framework we then estimate the dynamic game with monthly data from the taco fast casual restaurant industry in texas during 1993 to 2015 our estimated model primitives reveal that the incumbent taco cabana faces a strong entrant chipotle and in such a scenario our analytical insights suggest that the incumbent should avoid aggressive entry strategies victoria feng liked see all activity experience manager global risk management company name
