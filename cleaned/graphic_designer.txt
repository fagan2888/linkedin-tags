better than being certified testxperts is going through a very exciting journey and were expanding our team looking for engineers managers vp etc i met a candidate yesterday who had approached us for filling the vp position the interview started as usual and we had some interesting discussions during our discussion we also talked about how certification is different from skill you may know a lot of things but that knowledge is of use only when it turns into your skill some key points from the discussion  • most testers are after buzz words like automation frameworks performance scripting etc and they would do some courses get certifications to be a certified tester instead of being a skilled tester • you might be certified you may be having a masters degree but these would only be good once you have skill to use the knowledge you gained through these • if you want to remain in demand in this ever changing market be skilled and not just certified • certifications are given by external bodies who tell you that you are good at something your skill will tell others that youre good at something and this will not require external bodies certifying this for you susan liked the

my passion is in education and as a graphic web designer and through communication in printed spoken words and colors as a graphic web designer i help entrepreneurs to achieve profitable and sustainable growth through these ways of communication the reason i became a graphic designer is to pursue my love of colors and symbols and the effect it has on visual communication through graphic design i can mix all these elements to create something meaningful in conveying powerful messages the mistake many entrepreneurs and business owners have is that they dont understand that their business gives a message through the fonts symbols colors and their logos need to be original not a clip art i understand that as a small business or new business expenses can be high but a right logo or corporate image can open imaginable doors and that is something i see there is still a misconception on what real design isi became an author because i am passionate about life with lifes twists

unique insight was immensely valued even during the premature planning stages of projects and he provided a perspective that significantly improved the plan itself chris managed his team well counseling his team through what can be a challenging move from traditional waterfall methods to agile methods with the added stressor of production on a tight timeline here he excelled making sure to check in with his team frequently help them when they had questions about the agile process and provide assistance when unexpected roadblocks were encountered he made sure to support his staff in all ways possibleoverall it was a delight to work with chris no matter the situation he was ready to take on the day with a smile a joke or a pep talk  reminding his staff or those in other branches of
