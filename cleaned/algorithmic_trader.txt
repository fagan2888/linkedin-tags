understanding which reveals that he had an excellent insight on various concepts in quantitative principle i was able to recognize that he had a right aptitude for trading exotic derivatives as it crucial to perceive the complexity of the risk in the instruments he trade correctly and that he was a conscientious practitioner this was very encouraging because the more a person learns about what
