He is a man of high principles operating in a low-principles environment. Heroes typically get crucified or martyred in the end. Jim knew that when he took the job, but like good soldiers called to battle, felt the responsibility to serve. He deserves our thanks rather than scorn.

I interacted with himwhile working on a particular project involving network infrastructure. Additionally, since our globally distributed data management system relied on network connectivity, we would contact Vladimir as necessary for general network support.While necessarily complex, Networks at Fermilab have always been of rather high quality, thanks in large part to highly competent engineers such as Vladimir. Any outages were quite rare and short. I specifially recall the positive impact of Vladimir's responsiveness and reliability at the times of crises, whether or not they ultimately were network-related.Furthermore, Vladimir is a great learner who assumed over time a number of software development responsibilities. For example, Vladimir enjoyed studying and using Python and other scripting languages for his work.Overall, I know Vladimir as a knoledgeable, punctual and thoroughcolleague who would be a great asset in either financial or researchenvironment.If I could provide additional information, please contact me via email.Igor Shena R.

Yikang Luo Trade Support Engineer at the Divisa Capital March 30, 2016, Yikang and Miao were students together If somebody is smarter than me, I may be sort of frustrated; but if somebody is smarter and meanwhile, works harder than me, I would definitely show my respect. Miao is exactly the "somebody" who is smart and works hard. Based on the strong quant background from both Peking University and Beijing University of Technology, Miao did a perfect job on the backtesting session of our practicum project ETF enhancement with Social Market Analytics, Inc. Her knowledge of python and excel really impressed me. On top of that, her working efficiency should be emphasized as well, since she could always get the backtesting results in a very short time.Miao is also a very humble and easygoing lady. During our project, I learnt a lot of skills including python and excel from Miao. She always answers my question patiently. Those fantastic ideas of algorithms from Miao inspired me a lot as well.

The bond sentiment indicator incorporates bond mutual fund flows, speculative futures positioning, bond market implied volatility, and global sovereign bond market breadth. When the indicator moves to extremes it often marks turning points in bond yields. Now that the indicator has moved back to the low side, the risk of another jump in bond yields is higher. joel liked Today was a fantastic day; I lost my job.

Vivek Khanna Head of Operations September 30, 2008, Vivek and Manish were students together To me, Manish Jalan epitomises Energy. Whatever he does he adds passion to it. Whether he does dram or for that matter anything. He is ambitious, hard working and truthful by nature. I have seen him leading in various positions at IIT in exemplary manner. He is in Mumbai with his startup, and I am sure his persistence and dedication will make it a resounding success.

He is a geek, a nerd who drinks and sleeps on software codes. Dont be surprised if he talks to you casually and gets words like, "slow cpu", "memory loss", "you don't boot well with me", "your system crashes when I explain you something", "linux and my Girl Friend rocks" in his day-to-day conversations. He is a magician on the net and a very simple down-to-earth guy, away from his keyboard. Entrepreneurship runs in his veins (don't believe me? Check out Vakow.com, which he has built single-handedly). Always a delight to be in his company and hang around with him. Good that I am in Mumbai - I get to meet this nerd quite often these days. Ashwin Parthasarathy Innovation | Product Strategy | Technology Leadership September 30, 2008, Manish reported directly to Ashwin Ok, its 11 pm at night we are leaving the office - waving good night to Ashwin. I ask, "Aren't you leaving Ashwin?", and pat comes the answer - "Dude have to finish this design before the sun dawns and assign work tomorrow, so having a Night-Out". Such is the dedication towards computers this gizmo-geek has!! He is one of the few managers with whom you can play foos-ball, go for pizzas, burgers, bunk offices for movies (at times), and still get your work done to perfection, on-time and beyond expectations.

I strongly believe that her positive attitude, problem solving and analytical abilities, interpersonal skills, her ability to generate unique ideas and solutions, and her overall passion for learning, teaching, and improving business, make her stand out as both a project manager and a marketeer. That being said, I make a very strong recommendation for Ania Jabłonowski, without reservation, to any firm that is looking for someone to lead their marketing and sales initiative whether in a B2C or B2B capacity. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have anymore questions regarding her qualifications for a position within your firm. Brenda Thompson Equities at Jane Street Capital September 10, 2010, Brenda worked with Jacob in the same group Brenda Thompson is an seasoned veteran of the derivatives (specifically equity, index, and ETF options) industry with whom I had the pleasure of working with while a Trading Assistant within Jane Street Capital's CBOE floor-based trading operation (which was closed down in June 2009). While we were colleagues, Brenda, who was my indirect supervisor, exhibited herself to be an intelligent and proactive problem solver, a detail oriented team player, as well as a fun and easy person to work with. Knowledge, experience, a diligent work ethic, and a consistently (and refreshingly) positive attitude, all come as a package deal when one has the opportunity to work alongside Brenda, therefore, I make a very strong recommendation, without hesitation, for her. She would be an very tangible asset to any organization with which she is associated.

He has been involved in a number of front office projects at Goldman, delivering solutions for several trading desks and for the firm's clients. The last one I know about was a monumental effort by Core Strategies - Goldman's super quants - to make available to external clients large parts of the bank's risk-management system for equity and and fixed income derivatives.Robert's approach is goal-oriented, always accounting for both value added and timeliness. An effective team player, he also effortlessly communicates and coordinates across groups. I have personally asked him for help on multiple occasions. Even when he was no longer part of my team, he was highly responsive and either provided solutions directly or pointed to the appropriate people to contact. It is a pleasure to work with Robert both because of his professionalism as well as his positive attitude and exquisite sense of humor.
