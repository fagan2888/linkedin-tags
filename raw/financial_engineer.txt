Chris and I have known each other for over a year, and he has left me with the only impression of being " A highly self-motivated smart young guy with strong committment and dedication".In 2011, Chris contributed to developing an algorithm for implementing a multi-state & multi-variable regime-switching model framework to study the implications on the strategic asset allocation. This framework with richer dynamics in terms of the linkage between the macroeconomic fundamentals and asset behavior greatly facilitated the analysis and projections of asset returns under various economic regimes. The entire project turns out to be a high-quality research in the area of asset modelling, and Chris is highly honored for the early stage work of the project. During the term of this project, Chris also demonstrated his excellent quantitative skills and moreover, his self-motivation for new ideas and strong committment for high quality results greatly impressed me as well.I am looking forward to working with Chris again in the near future, and I strongly recommend him for future opportunities. hasn’t given any recommendations yet.

Thanks to Henry Schein Pouyan liked تركيه پايگاه نظامى بزرگى را در نخجوان كشور آذربايجان ايجاد كرد، و نيروها و تجهيزات نظامى زيادى را به نخجوان ارسال كرد. Pouyan liked Recently OntarioMD set up our office for secure e-consults. I sent out my first request last week - for a second opinion on a skin lesion. Basically I took a picture, uploaded it and sent it off for a dermatology opinion. I was reasonably sure that it was non-cancerous and I received a confirmation within two days. The process saved the patient a lot of time and money as he would have had to take a day off to go see the specialist. The dermatologist was paid adequately for his time and saved an appointment for another patient. So it was a win-win scenario. This is a great example of how technology can improve healthcare. While e-consults won't work in all situations, in other cases they will help to provide better and faster care, save the system a lot of money and create more availability for specialists. Next, I'm looking forward to using other technological advances such as e-referrals. What are you excited about?

He's a fantastic manager/developers and was able make great strides with the project. It was not an easy environment as the requirements kept changing, however, Chu-chi was up to the challenge. It was an honor and privilege working with Chu-chi and we already miss his input on our project. Thomas W. Hillman Data Engineer | Utility Fielder August 2, 2013, Thomas W. worked with Chuchi but at different companies I worked with Chu-Chi as a sub-contractor on a very important government program. This program has very high visibility within the larger organization and is critical to the work they do. Chu-Chi came in as a newbie to our customer but quickly took stock of the situation and set to work getting us the traction we were sorely lacking.Chu-Chi has strong leadership and analyst skills and he was able not only to get us better organized but he was able to get the customers to open up with what their real requirements were. Using a combination of Agile techniques and the tried&true waterfall SDLC's, we were able to produce a product that not only met the customers needs but was considered so important that the government sponsor pleaded with his management not to de-fund us (they actually gave us more money!).Chu-Chi was also able to make a solid business case for adding FTEs to the contract, something that in the government environment is hard to do unless you can develop a compelling business case, which Chu-Chi did. We were able to add two additional FTE's to the project and was able to back-fill any position that came open.As team members Chu-Chi gave us general direction but trusted us to make wise use of our time and allowed us to experiment with different ideas for solving an issue but always keeping an eye out for over-reaching and requirements creep. Chu-Chi also encouraged us to go beyond our position descriptions and to explore other areas on the project that were interest to us and expanded our skills.I believe the quality and length of the other recommendations speaks to Chu-Chi's skills both as a technologist and as a businessman and leader. There is not much more I could add.In closing I would just like to say that I would work with Chu-Chi again and when I am in a position of leadership will definitely seek him out as a trusted adviser and would work hard to convince him to come join any team or company that I might be leading.

We thought that he would be able to help the team understand how to implement the model, but in his time with K2 Graham did so much more. He broke down the model to each of it's elements and then spent the time building it better and with more accuracy than was done in the past. Graham become not just our behind the scenes guru but also a trusted advisor for our client in making major model changes. This level of trust that the client had in Graham was well warranted and his unique skill-set was pivotal to the projects success.Graham will be my first call whenever there is complex math that goes way over my head. Adam Wasserman, MBA, PMP Senior Digital Strategist at Jackman Reinvents December 1, 2016, Adam worked with Graham in the same group I worked with Adam on the Sentry Investments project at K2 Digital, where he played the challenging role of strategist for this complex engagement. Adam never stopped advocating for the client, even when it would have been easier not to. He worked hard with the client to turn their needs into something that could be built, and he worked hard with our team to ensure that what we were building fit, and that the client was happy with it. This takes some negotiation skills and analysis, and an attention to all of the details pertinent to the client. I'd be glad to work with Adam again on another project. Brook Ding Development Team Lead November 14, 2013, Graham worked with Brook in different groups Brook is great. He's a strong developer and an excellent team lead. He has good soft skills: humour, humility and very personable, easy to get along with. He's always expanding his skills. Brook and I have worked together for about 4 years, debugging, developing, designing functional specifications, and he has always been patient, friendly, accommodating, dedicated to getting the work done well, and willing to put in extra effort beyond what is asked.

The experience working in a dynamic industry within such a vital enterprise has afforded me the skills and knowledge needed to excel in my future endeavors. I have graduated from the Finance Rotational Program and have taken a full-time position in the Business Finance Analytics group as a Financial Engineer for the Multifamily business segment.I have recently begun an advanced academic program at The Johns Hopkins University. I am studying applied economics in pursuit of a Master's of Science graduate degree while continuing to work full-time at Fannie Mae.

By using historical realized trends, market driven assumptions, and Dodd-Frank specific scenario assumptions we create base, optimistic and pessimistic forecast scenarios. Once the analysis is complete I present the forecast results to key stakeholders, senior management, and the CEO of the Multifamily business.I validate the Multifamily guaranty asset and guaranty obligation for the fair value balance sheet on the $200B Multifamily book of business by ensuring economic inputs (i.e. LIBOR/TSY rates, housing inventory, employment, etc.) and production model results are correct and consistent with current market trends.I provide insightful analytics and control processes for the Multifamily loan loss reserve. Multiple analytics are needed to ensure the accuracy of the FAS5 collective and FAS114 specific reserve and therefore appropriate control processes must be in place.I prepare/review quarterly financial disclosures for Multifamily book characteristics, credit losses, and delinquency rates. I work cross functionally between the Multifamily business and Financial Reporting to ensure timely submissions of disclosures and answer the pertinent questions as to why/how the book changed QoQ.I advanced Multifamily model performance tracking by modifying existing processes to more accurately predict key drivers of loss within 20% of actual observations.

Good to school, get good grades and get a good job, you are all set for life. Sounds familiar, Are we really all set in life ? One of the most frequently asked questions for a child, what do you want to be when you grow up, instead of asking how do you want to live your life. Most people end up working 40-50 hours a week, get two days to do laundry, run errands, recreation, and get ready for next week. Some are happy with this routine, Some are unhappy and only complain and do nothing about it, whereas a handful do something about it. They ask themselves a slightly different question. What kind of life they want to live, and choose a path that would provide them the life they want. They create their own future. They don't chase PAYCHECK, they write their own PAYCHECK. They do not question their purpose, they find their PURPOSE!!!

Lei was an equity analyst covering the consumer discretionary sector and Asia ex/China region. During this time Lei prepared investment theses on numerous companies in his sector and region. In addition, Lei worked with IT professionals to develop the next generation portfolio management and tracking program for the the Global Equity Fund. Throughout his time with the Global Equity Fund, Lei was an excellent team member, who could always be counted on to perform tasks accurately and on time. Lei's communication skills were excellent, enabling him to work proficiently across functions and to explain his investment theses to other members of the Fund. Lei was a valuable member of the Global Equity Fund team, and will be a high performer in his future endeavors. Georgios Skoulakis Assistant Professor at The University of British Columbia August 23, 2011, Georgios worked with Lei but at different companies Lei was in the M.Sc.Financial Econometrics class that I taught in the Spring of 2011 at UMD. Lei was the only one out of 80 students that took the initiative and went through the pain of developing his own code (in MatLab) so that he can complete the assignments for the course. Besides some programming skills that he quickly developed, this task requires deep understanding of the underlying theory, concepts and issues.

I can vouch for Gopi as a very adept programmer and a quick thinker. He has a strong ability to quickly ingest a requirement and develop algorithms and programs to execute the request in a variety of languages including C, C++, VBA etc. Gopi also has the ability to turn his hands to new languages and applications, as he demonstrated by developing algorithms in Mathematica to analyse counterparty credit risk, and algorithms in MATLAB to calibrate interest rate models and value fixed income derivatives. I strongly endorse Gopinath, as a very skilled quant developer, with limitless potential, and as a very reliable, driven and committed individual that I could count on. I look forward to his future success. Jan Novotny eFX Quant at HSBC August 20, 2012, Jan was senior to Gopinath but didn’t manage directly Gopinath was a MSc. student and I was de facto supervising his work as a senior member of the research group at Manchester Business School, though not officialy. The topic covered the Counterparty Credit Risk issues applied for the Oil Swap and included both theory as well as numerical issues and simulations.GR was independent and able to manage difficult numerical issues in financial engineering on his own. He grasped new techniques and tools quickly and his critical attitude helped us to solve some advanced issues together. Phoebe Cheung Senior Consultant - Quantitative Analytics & Risk Management at Eames Consulting Group September 5, 2016, Gopinath was a client of Phoebe’s Phoebe has been very helpful throughout the recruitment process.From the first call, she offers her professional support and guidance to make the job hunting process more smooth.If she decides that a candidate has what it takes to fill a role, she does her utmost best to help her clients see that.Without her brave and persevering intervention, the client may have lost the right candidate, and likewise the candidate may have given up on a great opportunity to realize his/her full potential. Paramjot Kochar Technical Architect - IBM Analytics November 18, 2013, Gopinath was senior to Paramjot but didn’t manage directly Paramjot Kochar (Param) was my colleague at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for three years.While at TCS, Param's performance was exemplary. Param is a conscientious, highly-skilled technical architect. She is detail oriented and has a firm grasp of all technical terms. Param has a great ability to solve complex problems in a shorter time frame and a sure asset to any company. I wish best of luck in all her future endeavors.

When Govind first began working there, he was assigned the task of helping me maintain a large historical option price database in SQL. This database is populated across 3 country-specific platforms via multiple cronjobs by applications written in C, C++, and perl. His first priority was to ensure that the databases population was successful, and if not, to debug into the code and log files to address the problem. As he progressed in his work, he was given additional responsibilities which include log-analysis of our automated trading systems as well as testing and implementing a new theoretical volatility model. Govind has been successful in all the projects that he has worked on for our team. He has been a major asset in his role as a financial intern while he is finishing up his graduate degree. It was clear from the start that Govind was very ambitious and was up for any challenge. Not only does he do the work that is asked of him in a timely fashion, but he also goes a step beyond and suggests new ideas or ways of improving the current system. That being said, he also realizes his place within a team structure and is highly respectful of his superiors. His programming skills are efficient, and I am impressed by his desire to understand all of the details and quirks of any new programming language he learns (for instance, he learned Perl while working here). Govind is punctual and reliable and quite easy to talk with. I am happy to have Govind on my team, and am looking forward to working with him in the future. Maxim S. Quant February 4, 2009, Maxim managed Govind directly Govind has been working as an Intern in my Financial Engineers team for almost a year. Internship in our group in reality means an entry level Financial Engineer position with a lot of responsibilities. We assign our interns very important and practical projects and expect them to quickly become useful with minimum supervision. Govind has been quite successful in this role. He demonstrated very good programming skills and his main responsibility is helping one of our Financial Engineers with maintenance and improvement of our FE database, which has become noticeably more reliable now. In addition to that, Govind has been also working on a couple of research projects. He is making a good progress, and I plan to use his research in our trading algorithms. One project is implementation and evaluation of a certain new model for volatility skew in extreme strikes, the other project is estimation of average lag in options price change in reaction to the underlying price change. Govind is a very dedicated individual with a strong drive for achievement.

She is very good at understanding new technologies and has a immense acumen for testing. She is highly driven, organized and a very good team player. Overall she will be a good asset for any team. Himanshu Sharma Engineer SW at Cisco Systems September 3, 2009, Govind and Himanshu were students together I attended college with Himanshu and I worked with him in many academic projects in computer science. Himanshu always has new ideas to solve problems in programming. He was among the elite students in the class and has shown consistent performance. He is very good at understanding the intricacies of technology . We have participated in many college technical events and programming contest and he is the best team mate I ever had. I will be very much willing to work with him in a team. I would strongly recommend him for any challenging job.

I still remember when I first looked at his resume, the fact that he was a math major instead of a computer science major student caught my attention. I was in doubt that a candidate with little experience in computer programming could possibly be competitive enough for our demanding internship position. Unfortunately, I missed the interview with him due to a conference, but the rest of the recruiting team assured me that having him on board was the right decision to make. Mr. Pan proved this to be true during his internship by demonstrating his youthful spirit, great eagerness to learn and outstanding intellectual potential, which outshined his peer interns and even some entry-level full time employees.The only undergrad intern in my group that worked with 4 PhD interns, Jiren has proven problem-solving competency and pleasant personality, my team and I myself consider Mr. Pan as an asset to our department. hasn’t given any recommendations yet.

Yajur Mahendru Product Manager at CarDekho.com December 29, 2014, Yajur and Dhananjai were students together Dhananjai (DJ) has a very intuitive and curious mind. He is a complete 'data driven' person with great problem solving skills. He has a great passion for Mathematics. I know DJ since school days and had the opportunity to team-up with him in many group assignments and R&D projects during engineering. His ability to grasp things quickly and capability of scouting for solutions when faced with problems is outstanding. It was a great learning experience while working with DJ on university projects. I wish him all the best. Yajur Mahendru Product Manager at CarDekho.com January 6, 2015, Dhananjai and Yajur were students together I have known Yajur for eight years.

Being a good listener and pro active enough to remove bottlenecks in the project as soon as they arise makes him very good in intense team related skills.

An excellent team player, always willing to go the extra mile, she brings enthusiasm and engineering expertise to each project she works on. Colin Duggan Principal Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments July 21, 2009, Colin worked with Siofra in the same group I have known Colin for nearly four years and have worked with him on a number of occassions. Colin is a talented and highly-motivated software developer with a great knowledge of the financial services industry. Myself and Colin worked side-by-side on the same project for approximately one year. During this time he displayed good work-ethic and excellent technical ability with a flair for design. He always approaches tasks with enthusiasm and a positive attitude. His good-humour and approachability makes him popular with his colleagues. In addition, it has been my experience that Colin has an aptitude for dealing with customers and clients, and identifying long-term road-maps and strategies. Manisha Manchanda, PMP Manager at Sunlife Financial September 6, 2008, Manisha was senior to Siofra but didn’t manage directly I worked with Manisha on a high profile project in Fidelity and during this time she displayed great organisational and technical ability. Manisha's technical ability is of an extremely high standard for a person who is primarily in a project management role. I have no doubt that Manisha will perform her next role with the same vigour and thoroughness and she will be missed in Fidelity.

September 2, 2010, Will managed Prafulla directly It was a pleasure working with Prafulla throughout his internship. During his three month tenor in the Asset Valuation Group. He contributed a great deal to the team not only by increasing the quality of the underlying analytics code base, but also by providing quantitative support to our client coverage teams. He successfully completed a substantial refactoring of the analytics architecture to facilitate the ease of integrating various types of collateral modeling and term structure dynamics. He also built an excel based MBS pricing model to assist client support groups in understanding and communicating our option-adjusted pricing methodology. I recommend Prafulla whole-heartedly. Please feel free to contact me if you need further information. Katey Chieffe Business Technology Liaison August 30, 2010, Katey was senior to Prafulla but didn’t manage directly Praful stands out amongst technology related individuals with whom I have worked. I've worked with Risk models for more than 15 years. My role is on the data integration side, which means frequent interaction with IT for information support. Praful was exceptional in the way he took a personal interest in understanding the business, was able to grasp new finance topics quickly and adeptly bridged the gap between finance and technology. Praful is a tremendous developor as a result and came to understand the informational needs and uses of information in Risk applications better than most other technology folks with whom I've worked over the years. He was an absolute joy to work with and I knew he had wonderful potential when he let me know he was leaving to pursue a degree at CMU. I wish Praful all the luck as he graduates and moves forward, though I don't think he'll need much luck -- his interpersonal skills and expertise should be all he needs.Katey Chieffe Shri Deshpande Principal Consultant December 3, 2012, Prafulla reported directly to Shri I worked with Shri for about two years. As a manager, Shri has the rare skill of empowering those reporting to him to make decisions while also focusing on the strategic apects of the business. His approach to managing is highly collaborative and people-oriented. He personally invests in the growth and careers of those working with him and I have found his guidance and support extremely valuable over the course of my career. I am happy to endorse him and wish him all the best for his future endeavors. Will Gajate Research, Risk Management at Axioma Inc. December 14, 2010, Prafulla reported directly to Will Working with Will was a great learning experience that exposed me to the pricing and risk analysis of Fixed Income products. Will possesses a solid command over financial mathematics and software design, a unique skill set that makes him a valuable asset in the field of quantitative finance. Most importantly, Will is a great communicator who can translate complex mathematical and technical constructs efficiently and effectively to those around him as well as manage high performing teams with his mentoring and leadership skills. I learnt a lot from Will in a short span of time and feel privileged to have worked with him.

As the business evolved at the NYSE, he changed with it, adapting his professional skills in order to maintain a level of excellence pertinent to our operation. It was with great dismay that I learned of his decision to leave the company. Mike learned Q (KDB+) and Visual Basic during a short training session, and was one of two people in the department to embrace this software. He eventually became an expert in both languages, which paid many dividends in designing simulations of system capacity, analyzing the May 10th flash crash, and monitoring market quality across exchanges. I strongly recommend him as a top-notch quantitative analyst. Alex Gorodetsky Vice President, Electronic Trading, Global Equities at J.P. Morgan November 3, 2011, Alex worked with Michael in different groups I've gotten to know Michael the past couple of years from projects that tended to overlap. It's been a pleasure working with him and having the ability to learn from him the methodologies required to gauge operational efficiencies. Michael served as a great impromptu mentor – always willing to explain the work he was doing and eager to guide me in my own analysis. Michael exemplifies the strong traits and skills required to be a successful operational analyst.

I have worked with many over the course of my career and I was an Engineer myself so I think I know what it takes to be a good one. In my opinion it is not only following or accomplishing the product specifications correctly which Alex did an excellent job in; it is understanding the spirit of the product specifications. What it does, why it does it and how it fits within the greater product offering. Alex did not have a financial background, but he quickly started to understand the financial aspects of the projects we were implementing and they were quite complex. For example:- Creating a multi-bucket framework to model credit transitions.- Re-factoring a prepayment model architecture that was inherited from a previous software engineer.- Expanding the US Agency prepayment model into international markets by creating additional classes that accepted additional components.- Working with vendors to modify the data we pass from Intex to their model from structures to pointers.- Working on a distributed architecture and bulk loading schemes that improved performance by more than 60%.I would also like to add that in all those projects, Alex worked with our Quality assurance team proactively and made sure that his changes' impact was understood and well tested.My group will miss Alex's work ethic and contribution.

Goodrich, CPA, CIA, CISA Senior Lecturer III at University of Texas at Dallas August 19, 2009, Mary Beth W. was Akshay’s teacher Akshay went above and beyond as a student in my AIM - 6338 Course (Accounting Systems Integration and Configuration with SAP) which he took with me in the Spring 2009 semester. Known around UTD as the "Accounting SAP course", this course gives students that are technical, a great look at accounting process flows and gives accounting students exposure to the technical side of SAP and how SAP can be set-up for transactions to flow. It is a challenging course, which Akshay earned an A in and above and beyond scores for participating in the discussion board to assist students in trouble-shooting the SAP system. Akshay would provide relevant, helpful tips to students, both on how to use the system and why it was set-up that way. He has a great way of understanding both the technical side of the system and the accounting / procedural side of the system. His consistent dedication in the classroom demonstrates to me a strong work ethic and passion for learning. I would recommend Akshay for any career in which he has an interest. Frank Anderson Senior Lecturer at The University of Texas at Dallas August 19, 2009, Frank was Akshay’s teacher Mr. Ajmani was a graduate student in my FIN 6310, Investment Management class at the University of Texas at Dallas.I found Mr. Ajmani to be a serious and hard working student with a strong interest in wanting to know as much as he can on various topics of interest related to the field of Investment Management. In fact, he expressed a strong interest in wanting to sit for the CFA exams.

His biggest strengths are his quantitative and critical thinking and his passion for problem solving. With his excellent communication and relationship building skills, I am sure he will quickly rise to the top echelons of the corporate world. Karthik C - March 28, 2011, Akshay and Karthik were students together The first time I met Karthik was during the orientation in UTD where I being his senior had to advice him and other newly joined students onthe courses to take. To my surprise, Karthik came across as some one who had done complete immaculate research on the various courses offered, the professors and the subject content of those courses.He was some one who had the determination to succeed , had clear goals in minds of what he wanted to do during and after completing his MS .He wanted to earn his MS degree by taking courses that added value to his profile rather than looking for easy grades.Since I shared few courses(Business Intelligence , Marketing management, IT strategy) with him, my interaction with him became a lot more frequent. During the course project work, he was a standout performer irrespective of the tasks in hand-be it data analysis, researching, presenting the findings to the class ,coming out with new business ideas,answering queries with a lot of confidence and was always open to new ideas and suggestions.With Karthik being a part of any team, you can be rest assured of his committment to the team both in the technical and business domain, his deliverables and his never ending passion to learn new things really quickly.I wish karthik all the best for his future endeavours.

The results indicate that funding liquidity was the primary contributing factor behind the time series and cross-sectional variation in deviations from the law of one price.

Craig Zaayman MD:WIP treasury Solutions and Group Economist at Wiphold Ltd July 18, 2006, Craig managed Dr Antonie directly It is amazing to know and to work with someone with such a wealth of intelligence and knowledge and yet he is so humble.

View 1 more recommendation View 1 more recommendation recommendations Merell Nair Client Solutions Analyst at Barclays Africa Group Limited June 20, 2013, Dr Antonie was Merell’s mentor During 2011 Merrell was a fourth year student at Wits in the Programme in Advanced Mathematics of Finance. I supervised her project entitled "Implied Volatility skews of options on Single StockFutures." This project was very interesting where we looked at the shape and stability of the volatility surfaces for single name futures. Merrell was an outstanding student and she really excelled in all the research and computational analysis. This research project gave us new insights into the volatility skew dynamics for single name options.It was such a ground breaking piece of research that another student extended the work during 2012. This led to a research article being published in the North American Journal of Economics and Finance with Merrell being a co-author. The paper can be found at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940813000272.Merrell is a hard worker and she understands her subject field very well. I know she will excel in any of her future career paths. Tshifhango Ndadza Senior Market Risk Analyst - Public Investment Corporation March 1, 2011, Dr Antonie was Tshifhango’s mentor During 2010, Tshifhango studied at Wits. He was busy with his honours in Financial Mathematics. I helped him in choosing a topic for his project. We decided to look at volatility skews for illiquid instruments. We tried to establish a link between a liquid skew (as for the ALSI) and its constituents where there are no skews. I worked well with Tshifhango. He finished his project and was a good student, very diligent and hard working. He should achieve success in his career if he keeps that attitude.

He's bright, capable, learned and eager to study-up as need arises. Applying what is learned in school is terrific, and Brian does this very well. He also demonstrated the ability to adapt to the changing business requirements of the day to assure objectives are met. Anthony Suarez Head of Engineering - Amazon Container Services January 30, 2009, Brian worked with Anthony in the same group Brian is an exceptionally talented and professional individual. His positive attitude, unique detailed understanding of technology, and willingness to take on any challenge lead to his outstanding contributions on both team and leadership levels. Brian's commitment to quality and focus on providing simple solutions to complex problems are just a few reasons why he is an outstanding performer. Brian's quiet leadership is exemplified by the respect that his team and his colleagues have for him. Peter Wagner Managing Director at Affinity North June 18, 2015, Brian was a client of Peter’s Peter recently placed me in a position which I am happy with and I owe a lot of it to Peter's experience, relationships, and patience. He listened when I described the position I was looking for and he was ready with a few firms right out of the gate. Although the hiring process at my current firm was met with a few challenges (none of which had to do with Peter), he was patient and very attentive. He kept me in the loop along the entire process with phone calls every few days and things turned out great. I look forward to working with Peter in the future. John Westerdale Unix System Admin at Stryker February 18, 2010, John worked with Brian in the same group I'm lucky to have worked with John so early in my career. Still in college, I was new to the business world and John provided a quality of mentorship and guidance that was priceless at the time. More than anything, John showed me the value in approaching a problem from a unique angle; that the obvious solution was not always the best and hardly ever the most robust. Not only could you rely on John to provide an alternate solution, but you could trust that he'd be able to execute it deftly as well.

I have participated in many events with the institution and have spoken on their behalf several times: at the launch of the Pensioner's Parliament, events planned by the Age Sector Platform etc. I have also sat on panels with people such as the Chief of the PSNI to discuss issues that older and younger people face in modern society and how they can be remedied.

I've had many interviews, and for each opportunity, I get at least 3 to 4 interviews. They ask me to design, plan, and sometimes execute projects as a part of the interview process. Result is "everyone is impressed with my skills, mentality, qualities, attitude, and abilities" However They intent to skill abuse me and offer such a low package in the name of "Market is not doing well, and not many jobs available". Responsibilities, and commitment started to kill me slowly with the rent, and cost of living and so many bills in the list that are due, however I have so much faith that the right employer will come as long as I keep digging.

He learned very quickly, we assigned him a huge variety of tasks while he worked for us and he accomplished them with very little guidance and oversight. This included design, analysis, and test on spacecraft, when most of his studies had been focused on aircraft. He clearly loved being an aerospace engineer and displayed great enthusiasm for every project he was assigned. His relentless optimism was also a welcome counter to the grumpy negativity we older engineers tend to display. Michael Yun Director of Product at Redstar Ventures February 27, 2011, Michael managed Justin directly Justin aided me on freelance work, setting up a centralized document repository to connect multiple geographic residential outpatient treatment centers for a psychiatric non-profit. His work here allowed for on-demand QA of work and aided management to enforce documentation standards for patient care.

Her contributions to the mechanical design of a complex Mars airplane entry shroud and structure were critical and her design was validated during drop tests. Her knowledge of Pro Engineer was also critical on NASA work, though she had the flexibility to utilize Solidworks, Visio, or simply PowerPoint to convey design details.

Nikhil liked Today the VIX traded below 10 briefly intraday. A pretty rare occurrence. Since 1993, there have been only 18 days where it traded below 10 intraday and only 9 days where it closed below 10. In my opinion, the low VIX is not necessarily saying a correction is coming, it's simply saying when it "does" come, most market players won't be positioned for it. In other words, the magnitude of the next selloff will be proportionate to the lack of hedging.

In this internship, Tim is responsible for improving the quality of error messages generated by derivatives pricing software. I am very impressed by the progress he has made on this project. Tim is a self-starter and easily picks up new skills and concepts on his own. In fact, Tim takes every opportunity to further his skills and understanding. As just one example, he has stayed late at work in order to get more experience with the software to which his project applies. The error message project has benefitted significantly from Tim’s experience with C++ and knowledge of quantitative finance. In working on the project, he went well beyond the basic requirements of his assignments, and his perseverance in bringing to light potential issues and seeking out as many answers as needed to ensure clarity have been instrumental to the quality of the project. Furthermore, I am sure we would not have been able to move along as far as we have without Tim’s ability to communicate potential issues in a timely manner and his positive attitude.

I was always impressed with the accuracy and thoroughness of his device modeling work - sepcifically for the transistors used in TI's high density & high performance SRAM bitcells. Debarshi's proactive efforts to improve the accuracy & scope of the SRAM transistor models has been one of the key enablers for the SRAM cell design for 28nm node.

He was one of the smartest engineer I have interacted with. His astute knowledge of device physics, his ability to motivate himself and others and his amicable personality were key contributors to his success. His hard work was justly rewarded by the board of reagents with the Ben Streetman award, a University-wide prize given each year for outstanding research by a graduate student in electronic and photonic materials and devices. David is not only a great technical innovator, he is a motivating leader and a great communicator this is why I believe he will be an asset for any company that is lucky to have him. Saurabh Jain Engineer, Entrepreneur June 7, 2011, Debarshi and Saurabh were students together Saurabh is one of the finest technical mind I have encountered. In IIT Madras where I studied with him, he was regarded as an expert in computer engineering. He had set-up the network of directory servers at the electrical engineering computing lab, a task that needed in-depth understanding of network architecture. He is a great team player and will be an asset to any team he joins. This is why i strongly recommend Saurabh.

(https://lnkd.in/d5hzzJP) at the poster session of the 5th Empirical & Theoretical (ET) Symposium (held at Desautels Faculty of Management this year). Hope the conference participants will be able to swing by the poster to take a look! The abstract to our project can be found below: We study the relationship between aggressiveness and survival under the context of retail entry. Using a dynamic game of entry, we show numerically that the relationship between an incumbent aggressiveness and survival can either be positive or negative. While aggressive entry can help an incumbent survive in the long-run, it may also be harmful to the incumbent if the entrant is too strong. With the same modeling framework, we then estimate the dynamic game with monthly data from the taco fast casual restaurant industry in Texas during 1993 to 2015. Our estimated model primitives reveal that the incumbent (Taco Cabana) faces a strong entrant (Chipotle), and in such a scenario, our analytical insights suggest that the incumbent should avoid aggressive entry strategies.

It was managed using Agile methodology with lots of tight and incremental deliveries. Jerry was very enthusiastic about the work and always delivered on time. He worked well with the rest of the team and also demonstrated great problem solving capabilities especially by the way he systematically investigated and resolved a long outstanding memory leak issue. Qin Chen Financial Engineer IV at Fannie Mae April 3, 2011, Qin was senior to Jerry Huang, but didn’t manage directly I got promoted to Financial Engineer IV during Jerry worked as Financial Engineer I at Fannie Mae, Washington DC, February 2010 to January 2011. During this period of time, Jerry had made significant contribution to the success of Common Analytics and Modeling Platforms (CAMP), a.k.a. Fannie Mae Analytics (FMA).CAMP is a platform for valuation of mortgage backed securities (MBS). It is Fannie Mae’s proprietary financial calculator. The system calculates security prices, risk metrics, and cash flows, among other important financial values. CAMP financial models and algorithms include prepayment models, default and loss models, pricing algorithms, and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. CAMP is integral to Fannie Mae’s portfolio management businesses, risk management, and financial reporting.Jerry worked as financial analyst and software engineer in the model integration team to integrate analytic components into FMA which is used as engine to run the full book Guarantee Asset / Guarantee Obligation for company's 10K and 10Q reports. He fixed the memory blow up issue that crashed on production blades when FMA started the Importance Sampling process. IBM Purify process showed no memory leakage on the system. With his fix the memory usage is cut by half and very stable.He implemented the risk adjusted mark up (RAMU) pricing model in C++ on Linux for the Guarantee Asset / Guarantee Obligation (GA/GO) system.He developed interest rate environment conversion and comparison tool in shell and Perl scripting to convert Fair Value rate environment to FMA.Also, he created prepayment model chooser comparison tool in Perl which facilitate the data reconciliation process between Fair Value and FMA.Finally, Jerry developed unit test cases in C++ which the CruiseControl ran every night to build the system.

EFSI with its affiliated partner Essential Fund Services, LLC (“EFS”) administers more than $3 billion of client assets across 75 reporting entities.A critical factor separating EFSI from other fund administrators is our in-depth knowledge of the alternative investment industry and our commitment to fully understand a fund’s structure and investment strategy while ensuring the governing fund documents properly reflect fund economics prior to the commencement of operations.

Steve commented See all activity Experience Calypso Business Analyst Company Name AIB Dates Employed Jun 2015 – Present Employment Duration 2 yrs Location Dublin, Leinster, Ireland - Working alongside the SMEs gathering requirements and building Reports for Front Office, Back Office, Regulatory, Risk and Finance Reports. This role relates to Cross Products such as Loans/Deposits, EQD, IRD, Call Accounts. All Reports are very different so I am exposed to all departments in order to cater for both their intraday and EOD requirements.- The EOD Reports have been built within Transfer, Trade, Posting, Risk Config windows etc. Intraday reports have been built in the Calypso Workstation giving real time access to trade statuses.- Building these Reports requires determining the relevant output that needs extracted and creating the relevant Static Data Filters, Trade Filters, Filter Sets and Columns that need configured to retrieve this data. The Majority of these Reports are generated within Calypso and then exported to the relevant departments via Scheduled Tasks. This required both manual creation and customisation.- An example would be generating VAR Risk Reports. This required me to build curves within the test environment along with the configuration within the ERS Risk webstart of Trade Filters, Batches, Portfolio’s.
