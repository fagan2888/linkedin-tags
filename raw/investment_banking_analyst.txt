I had the pleasure of working with KC as the advisor to the Student Council, where KC was President. KC worked tirelessly for The Harvey School. He successfully integrated an online communications system where students could post comments, suggestions, or questions. KC ensured that each post was not only met with a personal response, but also that the question/issue was discussed at the next Student Council Meeting. KC is a hard worker and conscientious student. He successfully balanced his studies (he was valedictorian) with the responsibilities of being the President of the Student Council - all while being the captain of the football and rugby teams. He performed these duties with honor, grace under pressure, and a sense of humor. I recommend KC Testwuide wholeheartedly and without reservation.

It is not an exaggeration when I say I have never seen someone work so hard and efficiently as Lavine. When we won the Dodge & Cox Investment Case Competition it was Lavine who took the floor to present. Every step of the research process Lavine sat next to me and toiled away to hone our work as close to perfection as possible. Within the finance world his hand is large and the cards he holds are some of the best. I often joke that he will be portfolio manager of the year 2030, but that is only a joke for his pleasure. Obviously I hold a very high regard for Mr.Hemlani but it is really to my benefit that I have surrounded myself with such smart individuals only to further my own learning.Best regards,Pace Sid Choraria Value Investor - Portfolio Manager May 8, 2015, Lavine reported directly to Sid Sid is an original, passionate investor with a deeply rigorous thinking framework. I have had the distinct pleasure to work with Sid on an array of outperforming investment ideas and related research-intensive projects. Sid garners much respect by confidently leading through example in terms of his results-orientation, intense attention to details and an unparalleled work ethic. I am particularly impressed by his disciplined ability to synthesize hundreds (if not thousands) of pages of information into succinct, well articulated write-ups. It comes as no surprise that he repeatedly shines as a top-performer at investment competitions and as an Asian value investor. Importantly, Sid possesses extraordinary versatility and character that is admirable beyond the workplace. I am tremendously grateful to have been able to work with an investor and mentor figure of Sid's caliber.

I got out of a meeting and was flooded with whatsapp and newslinks on the Uber CEO's resignation. Very saddened by the news, no #superpumpedness there. Uber was one of my best jobs but also my hardest. I handled PR for 25 cities alone in the first three months and my city list grew 2x . Every day was a challenge (averaging 4 hours’ sleep). We were cramped into a small room in a service office, and worked Christmas Eve, New Year’s day, birthdays. I did conference calls as I was going through customs and security checks. BUT my story is not unique, the sacrifices everyone made (and still make) were immense because we believed in the mission and Travis. The lasting friendships I still keep, and my eternal admiration for many of my ex colleagues are a testament to the shared bond and culture. Don't believe everything you read. I have every bit of respect for Travis and the company (when, over the past few months, often wondered how he was coping with all this). No CEO who cares this much deserves this. Hopefully he’ll reset, recharge, and work on other amazing things again. #Uberon, Travis Kalanick. We’re proud of our fearless leader no matter what.

More Actions Costas has a account Costas Kargakos, CFA Loan Officer - Public Sector Lending in Greece European Investment Bank London Business School Luxembourg 500+ 500+ connections Send InMail Since October 2016, I am working as a Loan Officer for public sector lending operations in Greece, within the European Investment Bank (EIB). I joined EIB in September 2011, as a Financial Monitoring Officer, and for 5 years I was responsible for the assessment of the credit standing of EIB's corporate counterparts and their compliance with their financial contracts with EIB. I proposed internal credit ratings for counterparts, reviewed contracts, securities, assignments and guarantees, and proposed remedies to contractual breaches, while ensuring their implementation. Before joining EIB, I worked for 2 years (2009-11) in Eurobank Ergasias SA as a Loan Workout Officer, managing and restructuring a portfolio of problem credits with large corporate clients each having credit exposure with the bank higher than € 5M. During 2007-08, I worked as an Associate within the Leveraged Finance team of GE Commercial Finance in London, arranging senior and subordinated debt for private equity sponsored leveraged buy outs in Europe, working on numerous transactions. In 2008, I attended the Emerging Leaders Programme at London Business School and earlier, in 2006, received my MBA from INSEAD, studying both in Fontainebleau and in Singapore. During the MBA year, I worked in Yahoo UK, as a summer intern in the Finance Department. Before the MBA year, I lived and worked in Athens, Greece, where I completed my military service and worked for 5 years in Alpha Bank SA as a credit analyst, where I covered numerous companies in various economic sectors and worked on corporate valuations and investment project appraisals. I am also a CFA charterholder and hold a M.Sc. in Financial Mathematics from the Athens University of Economics and Business - having graduated at the top of the class - and a B.Sc. in Banking and Financial Management from the University of Piraeus - where I graduated top 10% of class with honours and received 4 scholarship awards for academic excellence.

I have witnessed his calm composure and hard work in business school and then in GE Capital as well. He had developed quite strong expertise in leverage transactions in very short span of team and was very good in catching fundamentals drivers of complex transactions before others. His intelligent but simplistic approach and down to earth attitude made him essential part of the group. Demetris Leontis General Manager at Xerographic Systems & Vice President at Cyprus Sports Organisation November 12, 2009, Demetris and Costas were students together It has been interesting and fun to work with Costas during our time at Insead. Both in class and during our numerous common group assignments he displayed a high level of professionalism, positive energy, great communication skills and an ability to add significant value to group discussions and problem solving exercises. Costas is very easy to get along and work with and I believe he would be a valuable addition to any team he joins. View 2 more recommendations View 2 more recommendations recommendations Jason K.

During our tenure together, he exhibited a very high work ethic, positive attitude, solid selling and research skills, and strong market awareness. His positive contributions during team and client meetings were highly appreciated internally and externally.

Still spending the bulk of my time in NYC as a General Partner at Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe (also now 13.5 great years). But I still have a big oar in the water in DC, where I have joined forces with my old friend Senator Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) at Lincoln Policy Group. I am joined by four of my longtime Alston colleagues -- Colin Roskey, Dan Elling, Rudy Missmar and Gina Sherick-- along with Blanche, her partner Robert Holifield (also both former Alston colleagues) and their excellent group of lobbyists and policy advisors. The lawyers on the team have also formed Scully, Roskey and Missmar to perform legal work that will support the Lincoln Policy group. Just a heads up for anyone looking for me?

I had the privilege of working with Jim in the Venture Capital group at William Blair. He is a champion of all things entrepreneurial with a demonstrated ability to simply make things happen. He is unequivocally the most networked, loyal and influential person I know. He is a different breed of bankers, due in large part to his experience co-founding Motorola Ventures, which was considered one of the strongest corporate venture capital funds. He has a deep understanding of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, and I have seen him directly deliver significant value to venture-backed companies. Jim dedicates substantial time helping these companies because he is so passionate about the work – and he works tirelessly to make an impact on the companies he works with. Jim has the strongest work ethic I’ve ever encountered, exhibits the highest level of integrity, and is a collaborative team player. But most importantly, Jim delivers results. If you have the opportunity to work with Jim and watch him work his magic, consider yourself lucky. He is a rare breed and a truly exceptional person.

We gave our interns a wide range of responsibilities. Bryan took those tasks in stride and performed above our expectations. He is very diligent and thorough and finished all assignments that were “thrown” at him by our team. Bryan is a very intelligent and thoughtful person and thinks about vary aspects of very complex assignments. Bryan also showed that he was very proficient at valuation work and was valuable in this role too for our banking and due diligence team. He is a good self starter and fast learner (good at picking up concepts and learning about the economics of the industry we cover).

See moreSee more of undefined summary Highlights Follow Follow Nicole’s Activity 678 followers After taking a career break for most of the noughties to raise my two children and manage my personal investment portfolio, I was blessed to take part in the Goldman Sachs Hong Kong 2009 Returnship program. Following the program, I had the opportunity to lead Consultant Relations in Asia Pacific ex Japan for GSAM. I enjoyed a very stimulating and successful 7 years, working with a wonderful group of clients and colleagues. Regretfully, due to an internal restructure, my time at GSAM has come to an end and I am now looking for my next opportunity. With my extensive sell and buy side experience, as well as my proven adaptability to new challenges, I am open to a broad range of possibilities across financial services. I believe that I can add value to many organisations by leveraging my trading, technical, sales, business development, interpersonal and leadership skills to solve complex problems, build client focused businesses and lead teams to achieve great results. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss suitable roles and, furthermore, can I respectfully ask that you “Like” this post as it will help me to cast my net wider and hopefully unearth some interesting opportunities here in Hong Kong.

In both roles she demonstrated great initiative, flexibility, resilience and attention to detail. The BlueNotes project, as online journalism, was completely new to Nicole but her ability to develop new skills, work pro-actively with a very diverse group of stakeholders and support the launch of the project was first class.

Instead of having to roll out their instant high-tech stores nationwide they just bought all of the distribution at once, already tied to a brand of quality. We are about to witness Whole Foods become the most tech advanced store. It might take 3 years to really implement, but the future Whole Foods will look very different than now.

Fundamentally, I believe smart people should build things. This belief has fueled my interest in entrepreneurship and investing which I pursued by starting Jama Cocoa and A-Level Capital, leading JHU's Marshal L. Salant Student Investment Team and interning at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. I look forward to a lifelong journey of identifying opportunities and organizing the capital and talent needed to successfully deliver products that people want. I took the first step on this path by joining Goldman Sachs upon graduating from college and I'm excited to continue on this journey by focusing on early-stage tech businesses at FirstMark Capital.

Demi liked Today I received my JD from Stanford Law School. I have had the most incredible three year journey at Stanford. I studied law alongside some of the brightest minds I know, and I learned software engineering from the nearly perfect Stanford Computer Science Department. I am very excited for the next phase of my career. After taking the New York Bar in July, I will travel, and then start my job as an associate at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in October. Simpson is an amazing firm, and I look forward to learning the ropes by working with professionals who in many cases pioneered modern transactional law. I believe that the coming years will be an exciting time for lawyers, as technology stands poised to transform the delivery of legal services. With the training in law and computer science I have received at Stanford and the relationships I have formed, I cannot wait to dive in to this evolving field!

Fundamentally, I believe smart people should build things. This belief has fueled my interest in entrepreneurship and investing which I pursued by starting Jama Cocoa and A-Level Capital, leading JHU's Marshal L. Salant Student Investment Team and interning at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. I look forward to a lifelong journey of identifying opportunities and organizing the capital and talent needed to successfully deliver products that people want. I took the first step on this path by joining Goldman Sachs upon graduating from college and I'm excited to continue on this journey by focusing on early-stage tech businesses at FirstMark Capital.

Demi liked Today I received my JD from Stanford Law School. I have had the most incredible three year journey at Stanford. I studied law alongside some of the brightest minds I know, and I learned software engineering from the nearly perfect Stanford Computer Science Department. I am very excited for the next phase of my career. After taking the New York Bar in July, I will travel, and then start my job as an associate at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in October. Simpson is an amazing firm, and I look forward to learning the ropes by working with professionals who in many cases pioneered modern transactional law. I believe that the coming years will be an exciting time for lawyers, as technology stands poised to transform the delivery of legal services. With the training in law and computer science I have received at Stanford and the relationships I have formed, I cannot wait to dive in to this evolving field!

They may sound like simple traits or skills but I think at the core of it, understanding that those traits make up the foundation of my personality means you know exactly what kind of a person I am when I stand in front of you. Competition: All sports have a winner. In the world of business, you are in competition with the fellow businesses in your industry and while there may be no "losers", at times the "winners" often enjoy a higher market share, a higher take in profits, a higher chance of survival. On an individual level I strive to compete in much of what I do, whether it is against myself and my personal records or whether it is against my peers be it in the workplace or on a sports field. Teamwork: This may seem like a contradiction to my initial paragraph but I can say this, there is no level of satisfaction higher than that of winning as a team. When my soccer team won a tournament, the sheer joy of jumping up and down together in celebration of our hard work and well deserved victory, very few moments come close. When a fellow colleague struggles and I struggle with them and together we make it through the work project or goal, the relief, satisfaction and celebration is much sweeter when it is shared than when it is taken in alone. Relationships: To some, networking has become a dirty word. A stigma has been attached to it. To me it has always meant the same thing, making friends and helping each other out. It is the feeling of that split second of happiness when you run into an old friend or colleague in a place you least expected to find them. It's the feeling of knowing that when you walk into a familiar area and knowing you aren't alone. Wherever I go, I want to be remembered. Not for showing up, not for doing the minimum, but for being the best, for caring and helping others, and most importantly, for having a positive impact on those who choose to be around me.

They may sound like simple traits or skills but I think at the core of it, understanding that those traits make up the foundation of my personality means you know exactly what kind of a person I am when I stand in front of you. Competition: All sports have a winner. In the world of business, you are in competition with the fellow businesses in your industry and while there may be no "losers", at times the "winners" often enjoy a higher market share, a higher take in profits, a higher chance of survival. On an individual level I strive to compete in much of what I do, whether it is against myself and my personal records or whether it is against my peers be it in the workplace or on a sports field.

Relationships: To some, networking has become a dirty word. A stigma has been attached to it. To me it has always meant the same thing, making friends and helping each other out.

My dad has always questioned what the value was in getting good grades if he couldn't sell them to anyone. Now that he has a medal to sell, he's pretty thrilled. Andrew liked William Blair’s Brent Gledhill welcomes our second class of LIFT MBA participants #diversity #futureleaders Andrew liked This week, I graduated from Western with an HBA and BHSc. Incredibly grateful for my wonderful experience at Western and Ivey, and looking forward to what the future holds! Andrew liked I am proud to say that I have successfully graduated from the University of Guelph-Humber with an Honours Bachelor of Business Administration from University of Guelph as well as a Business Administration Diploma, specializing in International Business from Humber College, with Distinction. I would not have gotten this far without the support from amazing faculty members such as Justin Medak, MBA, CPA, CA, PMP, encouraging alumni such as Michael Legosz and Tomson Varghese and inspiring business professionals such as Kourtney Dupak. Thank you to all those who have supported and encouraged me these past four years. This is just the beginning! I will be joining the Smith School of Business At Queen's University in September for a Master of International Business to continue my journey in becoming a Consultant.

His technical skills were impeccable, although I'll always appreciate his ability to keep sight of the strategic "big picture" amid detailed financial models. Jason Nelson Global Head of Marketing, Life Cycle Services and Engineered Services Solutions March 27, 2010, Jason and Jason were students together Jason acted as the coach for the International Busines team for the case competitions program at JMSB. He sacrificed many late nights helping our team develop our content, improve our case analysis, and hone our presentation skills. He showed us how to examine the cases from different angles, and had creative suggestions for all our recommendations. Most important, though, he helped us develop a presentation style that best showed off our respective skills to the judges. At the Jeux du Commerces case competition, our team won gold, and it would have surely been impossible without Jason's help.

His technical skills were impeccable, although I'll always appreciate his ability to keep sight of the strategic "big picture" amid detailed financial models. Jason Nelson Global Head of Marketing, Life Cycle Services and Engineered Services Solutions March 27, 2010, Jason and Jason were students together Jason acted as the coach for the International Busines team for the case competitions program at JMSB. He sacrificed many late nights helping our team develop our content, improve our case analysis, and hone our presentation skills. He showed us how to examine the cases from different angles, and had creative suggestions for all our recommendations. Most important, though, he helped us develop a presentation style that best showed off our respective skills to the judges. At the Jeux du Commerces case competition, our team won gold, and it would have surely been impossible without Jason's help.

G.I.R.L. Go-Getter, Innovator, Risk Taker, Leader~ Proud ARMY Mom July 8, 2013, Carina was Raymond’s mentor I was Raymond's Red Cross advisor while he was at Mt. Miguel HS, he was the ASB President at the time and responsible for coordinating the blood drives at his school. It is never an easy task to run a successful blood drive but it is an even bigger challenge when you are working with so many young people who have never given blood before. Raymond led a team of enthusiastic young students who did their best to make every blood drive a success. Raymond led the team with strong leadership skills, a fine sense of humor, waves of positivity and an encouraging hand. No matter what challenge came up during the blood drives, Raymond would always say "Don't worry Mrs. K, we got this." I knew that when it was time to work with Mt. Miguel HS, I could rest easy knowing that Raymond and his team would go above and beyond making their blood drive a great event for everyone, students, teachers and neighbors. His can-do attitude, friendliness and genuine concern for his fellow students, made him a joy to work with. Rita Mae Nuevo Associate Producer at Gap Inc./Old Navy October 29, 2014, Raymond and Rita Mae were students together I have known Rita Mae for over 7 years and have worked with her on countless peer projects. Her work ethic is something to be admired as she has a unique ability to both successfully balance a number of projects of similar deadlines and prioritize projects based on need. Additionally, she is versatile, process-oriented, and understands her role on a team in any project she is placed in. These abilities equips her with a qualification that can't be quantified and would be beneficial two-fold for any team in the long run. She also possesses the ability to tackle any issue head on, and she can think on her feet to troubleshoot a situation. Moreover, with over 10 years of experience as a performer in the entertainment industry, she will provide value as she will bring insight, perspective, a large and successful network, and the right mentality to any team that she works with. Carina Kagan Adult and Girl Recruitment Specialist at Girl Scouts. G.I.R.L. Go-Getter, Innovator, Risk Taker, Leader~ Proud ARMY Mom July 9, 2013, Raymond worked with Carina but at different companies I was the ASB President of Mount Miguel High School from 2010-2011. During my term, I worked on numerous blood drives with Carina. MMHS had a relationship with other organizations that helped get donated blood, but when Carina came to our campus, our ASB decided to cut ties with other organizations and fully commit to the American Red Cross.The students at MMHS were met with a welcoming team from ARC and were treated very well. In fact, we broke the Mount Miguel record for most units of blood donated in my term and under the supervision of Carina! We had so many students line up, that they actually had to end up turning students away because it was getting too late.A lot of this success came from how Carina ran things. She had a natural ability to work well with young high school students who were volunteering as well as assuring and encouraging blood donors. She has interpersonal skills ideal of an American Red Cross representative and the results of her blood drives certainly reflects her ability to inspire students to donate. As a UCLA student, I have seen the impact of the blood donating experience when you don't have someone like Carina on board. My recommendation extends past her experiences and towards future opportunities that will allow her to empower students to do more than just donate, but to step up and encourage others to donate as well.

G.I.R.L. Go-Getter, Innovator, Risk Taker, Leader~ Proud ARMY Mom July 8, 2013, Carina was Raymond’s mentor I was Raymond's Red Cross advisor while he was at Mt. Miguel HS, he was the ASB President at the time and responsible for coordinating the blood drives at his school. It is never an easy task to run a successful blood drive but it is an even bigger challenge when you are working with so many young people who have never given blood before. Raymond led a team of enthusiastic young students who did their best to make every blood drive a success. Raymond led the team with strong leadership skills, a fine sense of humor, waves of positivity and an encouraging hand. No matter what challenge came up during the blood drives, Raymond would always say "Don't worry Mrs. K, we got this." I knew that when it was time to work with Mt. Miguel HS, I could rest easy knowing that Raymond and his team would go above and beyond making their blood drive a great event for everyone, students, teachers and neighbors. His can-do attitude, friendliness and genuine concern for his fellow students, made him a joy to work with. Rita Mae Nuevo Associate Producer at Gap Inc./Old Navy October 29, 2014, Raymond and Rita Mae were students together I have known Rita Mae for over 7 years and have worked with her on countless peer projects. Her work ethic is something to be admired as she has a unique ability to both successfully balance a number of projects of similar deadlines and prioritize projects based on need. Additionally, she is versatile, process-oriented, and understands her role on a team in any project she is placed in. These abilities equips her with a qualification that can't be quantified and would be beneficial two-fold for any team in the long run. She also possesses the ability to tackle any issue head on, and she can think on her feet to troubleshoot a situation. Moreover, with over 10 years of experience as a performer in the entertainment industry, she will provide value as she will bring insight, perspective, a large and successful network, and the right mentality to any team that she works with. Carina Kagan Adult and Girl Recruitment Specialist at Girl Scouts. G.I.R.L. Go-Getter, Innovator, Risk Taker, Leader~ Proud ARMY Mom July 9, 2013, Raymond worked with Carina but at different companies I was the ASB President of Mount Miguel High School from 2010-2011. During my term, I worked on numerous blood drives with Carina. MMHS had a relationship with other organizations that helped get donated blood, but when Carina came to our campus, our ASB decided to cut ties with other organizations and fully commit to the American Red Cross.The students at MMHS were met with a welcoming team from ARC and were treated very well. In fact, we broke the Mount Miguel record for most units of blood donated in my term and under the supervision of Carina! We had so many students line up, that they actually had to end up turning students away because it was getting too late.A lot of this success came from how Carina ran things. She had a natural ability to work well with young high school students who were volunteering as well as assuring and encouraging blood donors. She has interpersonal skills ideal of an American Red Cross representative and the results of her blood drives certainly reflects her ability to inspire students to donate. As a UCLA student, I have seen the impact of the blood donating experience when you don't have someone like Carina on board. My recommendation extends past her experiences and towards future opportunities that will allow her to empower students to do more than just donate, but to step up and encourage others to donate as well.

Read our 50+ Client Testimonials below. July 26, 2016, Vikram was a client of Svetlana’s Building and leading a high-growth company is exhilarating, but can take a toll on one’s health. I have always had an active lifestyle, but as Lana will teach you “no amount of exercise can overcome a bad diet!” I engaged Lana earlier this year with the goal of helping me eat right to complement my marathon training. Not only have I lost a fair amount of weight, but also feel more energised, have gotten rid of all my cravings, and generally feel much healthier! The best part is that her "no-frills" method around change is consistent, and everlasting. If you have the will and discipline to improve yourself, I highly recommend engaging Lana. The lessons she has taught me are invaluable, and are today helping me and my family enjoy life to the fullest!
