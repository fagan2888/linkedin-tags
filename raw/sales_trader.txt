We were in the process of buying a house when the housing market had totally tanked and was in great disarray. We initially met with Bill early in August and were closing on our condo two weeks later. From the beginning, he was extremely thorough and patient, which was needed as we were first time home buyers. His creative ideas and detailed product knowledge provided us with options at a time when there seemed to be none. Bill has continued his high level of service by keeping us up on the continually changing mortgage markets and setting us up to take advantage of market conditions going forward. I highly recommend Bill McHugh to anyone in need of a mortgage manager.

Commercial Market Intelligence: Opportunities abound in Charleston’s commercial real estate market.

We have been consistently trading in institutional equities flow with over 450 block size transactions in the 1st half of 2015, our Capital Markets team has been a selling group member of over 20 deals YTDGlobal Focus which means International, Emerging, Frontier and US - Global agency business mainly serves: all institutional asset management clients and macro HFs but also a further focus on Pension/Corporate/RIA & Wealth Managers which are traditionally underserved (especially in South Eastern US) into the INTL markets and general execution services across US listed ADR/ETF businesses). Our product advantage comes from living and working and managing businesses INSIDE the INTL/emerging markets for over a decade which brings a proprietary collection of local bank, broker, media and insight relationships. High Touch / Relationship driven – Given our collective lifetime’s work living, breathing and dealing in the INTL markets, our network of resources is unparalleled for materially relevant client needs such as: market intel/pulse on/off exchange, local research capturing, corporate access and of course block flow calls to give clients consistent outstripped access to the lesser liquid yet more volatile INTL markets. The machines cannot go everywhere clients need to go in our universe and there will always be “tail risk” that must be managed with high quality, low impact execution. We thrive on this fact and believe our need will grow as the larger banks continue to reduce its qualified trading staff for “execution consultants” who have limited years’ experience and in most cases no high touch block trading experience at all to handle the portion of your portfolio that truly needs low impact execution.

Christina efficiently learned her operational assignments and became a trusted member of the team. Her position at Esposito required her to juggle a variety of tasks and roles which she did adeptly. I should also add, she did so with a pleasant demeanor.Despite both of our careers taking us to different firms, we have remained in touch. Over the course of this time, I have been impressed by Christina's desire to improve her education and certifications by pursuing CFA certification. This is no easy task and requires multiple years of dedication. Furthermore, she has taken the time to examine the various niches of the investment industry and determine which holds the most interest for her. She is now working to push her career along that path.In closing, due to Christina's intelligence, ambition and personality, I know she will have a successful career and I look forward to seeing her reach further goals and accomplishments. Darla Tate Director of Philanthropy at ACH Child and Family Services December 21, 2011, Darla worked with Matthew in the same group I am writing to provide a recommendation for Darla Stricklin. I have come to know her well over the past year in her role with the National Psoriasis Foundation. Over this period of time, I have worked with Darla closely in forging a regional division for the Foundation and organizing two walk-a-thons. Over this time frame, I have been very impressed with her ability to organize and delegate in a firm but friendly manner. She has taken a lose band of a dozen people with different backgrounds and schedules and molded the division into a well run organization with clear goals and structure. Her ability to multi-task responsibilites across a wide geographic region and different local chapters is impressive. She accomplishes this with attention to detail and a touch of class to boot. I can provide a prime example of Darla's abilities. Two years ago, Darla was suddenly handed the responsibilty of completing the preparations for our walk-a-thon only 1 month before the date of the walk. The complete tenor of our planning changed immediately. We all had a better sense of what we needed to accomplish as a group and individuals. We went from having doubts about our ability to put the walk together to knowing we would pull it off and that it would be a success. This was soley due to her direction and guidance.

Our product advantage comes from living and working and managing businesses INSIDE the INTL/emerging markets for over a decade which brings a proprietary collection of local bank, broker, media and insight relationships. High Touch / Relationship driven – Given our collective lifetime’s work living, breathing and dealing in the INTL markets, our network of resources is unparalleled for materially relevant client needs such as: market intel/pulse on/off exchange, local research capturing, corporate access and of course block flow calls to give clients consistent outstripped access to the lesser liquid yet more volatile INTL markets.

We thrive on this fact and believe our need will grow as the larger banks continue to reduce its qualified trading staff for “execution consultants” who have limited years’ experience and in most cases no high touch block trading experience at all to handle the portion of your portfolio that truly needs low impact execution.

Christina efficiently learned her operational assignments and became a trusted member of the team. Her position at Esposito required her to juggle a variety of tasks and roles which she did adeptly. I should also add, she did so with a pleasant demeanor.Despite both of our careers taking us to different firms, we have remained in touch. Over the course of this time, I have been impressed by Christina's desire to improve her education and certifications by pursuing CFA certification. This is no easy task and requires multiple years of dedication. Furthermore, she has taken the time to examine the various niches of the investment industry and determine which holds the most interest for her. She is now working to push her career along that path.In closing, due to Christina's intelligence, ambition and personality, I know she will have a successful career and I look forward to seeing her reach further goals and accomplishments. Darla Tate Director of Philanthropy at ACH Child and Family Services December 21, 2011, Darla worked with Matthew in the same group I am writing to provide a recommendation for Darla Stricklin. I have come to know her well over the past year in her role with the National Psoriasis Foundation. Over this period of time, I have worked with Darla closely in forging a regional division for the Foundation and organizing two walk-a-thons. Over this time frame, I have been very impressed with her ability to organize and delegate in a firm but friendly manner. She has taken a lose band of a dozen people with different backgrounds and schedules and molded the division into a well run organization with clear goals and structure. Her ability to multi-task responsibilites across a wide geographic region and different local chapters is impressive. She accomplishes this with attention to detail and a touch of class to boot. I can provide a prime example of Darla's abilities. Two years ago, Darla was suddenly handed the responsibilty of completing the preparations for our walk-a-thon only 1 month before the date of the walk. The complete tenor of our planning changed immediately. We all had a better sense of what we needed to accomplish as a group and individuals. We went from having doubts about our ability to put the walk together to knowing we would pull it off and that it would be a success. This was soley due to her direction and guidance.

I am responsible for voice and electronic trading for distinct fixed income portfolio strategies including unconstrained global macro, Asian local bond, Asian credit, Japanese bond, emerging market debt and onshore China bond (via QFII & RQFII licence), as part of a centralised global dealing desk.

It manages assets for institutional clients, fund distributors and ING labels, with approximately €326 billion in assets under management.I began this role as a money market dealer, managing short term cash portfolios after being hand-picked to join and train with the fixed income team from my previous role at ING Investment Management. My role was broadened to include credit portfolios and FX and I cut my teeth during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009, when extreme market volatility, illiquidity and panic were all normal events. I was required to step into more senior responsibilities due to team resourcing shortages. This provided me with a strong insight into the importance of liquidity in financial markets and how quickly it can evaporate. My final role was as a portfolio manager and dealer for fixed and floating rate credit and money market portfolios (AUM: AUD$2bn credit, AUD$5bn cash). I had responsibility for contribution to portfolio construction, investment/trade decisions, fund performance, reporting and mandate complianceI also undertook regular client and asset consultant presentations regarding fund performance, portfolio construction, investment process and market outlook.

He has strong market sense and is also very up-to-date with market developments and news flows. He is also easy going and market friendly, and that helps him build long term relationship with counterparties and in turn good for sourcing liquidity when needed. He has made a name for himself as a reasonable and responsible trader, which helps him navigate well in this market. Emma Quinn Global Co-Head of Equity Trading, AllianceBernstein December 15, 2016, Emma managed Adrian directly I was Adrian’s direct manager during his role as a Fixed Income and FX Trader from 2012 to 2015 He was integral in helping to elevate the Asia-Pacific Fixed Income Trading Desk to become an important part of the global fixed income team. He was responsible for sourcing liquidity for global and regional portfolios to ensure best execution of orders. He always maintained a strong risk management and compliance focus during all his trading activities. Adrian has a strong understanding of the trading dynamics and market micro-structures of 12 Asia Pacific markets across credit, rates and FX products and sought to add value with daily market commentary, team meeting updates, trade ideas and client presentations. He was responsible for developing and maintaining relationships with a panel of counterparties to ensure best execution and access to resources for the broader investment team. He maintained his and AB’s reputation with the street to high standards. He had also begun to become more involved with industry groups in Asia. Adrian is a strong team player who desires the best outcomes for the group, sought to share knowledge and was well regarded in the firm. I would recommend Adrian to any prospective employer.

In a frank first sales meeting, I told him that after being disappointed with previous coverage and pricing, he would need to work hard to rebuild the relationship and for DB to remain relevant to the trading desk. He agreed he would and despite my initial skepticism of the initial meeting as just "another sales pitch", this was backed up by the right actions. From a very small market share of FX trades in Asia, John built the relationship and significantly increased DB's share of trading volume and relevance to AB. A great communicator, with extensive product understanding and technical knowledge. John provided timely and relevant market colour and flows. He had strong relationships with traders which ensured very competitive pricing and provision of liquidity across both electronic and voice trading. He was consistent and always relevant in his coverage of the trading desk without being overbearing. John integrated well with the broader investment team at AB from portfolio managers to research professionals. This is a big gap that a lot of sales people fail to focus on. He consistently sought to bring relevant DB research and trading specialists to the office to update the AB team. These meetings were always engaging and informative and resulted in some very lively debate across both firms. Feedback from broader investment teams of John was always positive. Away from the office, he is a dedicated family man and also a mean lead singer. I would highly recommend John to any prospective employer or business partner and would happily work with him again in the future. Joseph Grise Vice President, Emerging Market Debt Trading at AllianceBernstein May 26, 2015, Joseph worked with Adrian in the same group A high impact emerging market fixed income trader with broad market experience. A collaborative team player who communicates and contributes constructively. I worked with Joe for over 3 years while at AB, with both of us part of the global EM fixed income trading group; Joe based in New York and me in Hong Kong. Over that time, we worked closely to develop greater integration between the Hong Kong and New York trading desks across Asian fixed income products in order to optimize liquidity across a 24-hour trading day in order to achieve best execution for AB’s global clients. This resulted in us passing parts of the trading book between the HK and NY desks in both primary and secondary markets and a coordinated global approach to trading Asian fixed income. We also shared market intelligence on an ongoing basis to better understand market positioning and technicals, which has benefited all global investment teams. I found Joe to be professional, highly knowledgeable in fixed income and FX markets and a strategic trader with excellent relationships with AB’s global portfolio management and research teams. I also appreciate Joe’s candor in telling things like they really are! A rare quality these days. I highly recommend Joe and would gladly work with him again if the opportunity arose.

BNP Paribas Investment Partners actively manages EUR 497 billion of assets under its management and advisory activities, offering a comprehensive range of solutions for every type of investment profile, covering all major asset classes worldwide.

It manages assets for institutional clients, fund distributors and ING labels, with approximately €326 billion in assets under management.I began this role as a money market dealer, managing short term cash portfolios after being hand-picked to join and train with the fixed income team from my previous role at ING Investment Management. My role was broadened to include credit portfolios and FX and I cut my teeth during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009, when extreme market volatility, illiquidity and panic were all normal events. I was required to step into more senior responsibilities due to team resourcing shortages. This provided me with a strong insight into the importance of liquidity in financial markets and how quickly it can evaporate. My final role was as a portfolio manager and dealer for fixed and floating rate credit and money market portfolios (AUM: AUD$2bn credit, AUD$5bn cash). I had responsibility for contribution to portfolio construction, investment/trade decisions, fund performance, reporting and mandate complianceI also undertook regular client and asset consultant presentations regarding fund performance, portfolio construction, investment process and market outlook.

He has decent understanding of company fundamentals in Asia credit and understands bond technicals very well. He has strong market sense and is also very up-to-date with market developments and news flows. He is also easy going and market friendly, and that helps him build long term relationship with counterparties and in turn good for sourcing liquidity when needed. He has made a name for himself as a reasonable and responsible trader, which helps him navigate well in this market. Emma Quinn Global Co-Head of Equity Trading, AllianceBernstein December 15, 2016, Emma managed Adrian directly I was Adrian’s direct manager during his role as a Fixed Income and FX Trader from 2012 to 2015 He was integral in helping to elevate the Asia-Pacific Fixed Income Trading Desk to become an important part of the global fixed income team. He was responsible for sourcing liquidity for global and regional portfolios to ensure best execution of orders. He always maintained a strong risk management and compliance focus during all his trading activities. Adrian has a strong understanding of the trading dynamics and market micro-structures of 12 Asia Pacific markets across credit, rates and FX products and sought to add value with daily market commentary, team meeting updates, trade ideas and client presentations. He was responsible for developing and maintaining relationships with a panel of counterparties to ensure best execution and access to resources for the broader investment team. He maintained his and AB’s reputation with the street to high standards. He had also begun to become more involved with industry groups in Asia. Adrian is a strong team player who desires the best outcomes for the group, sought to share knowledge and was well regarded in the firm. I would recommend Adrian to any prospective employer.

In a frank first sales meeting, I told him that after being disappointed with previous coverage and pricing, he would need to work hard to rebuild the relationship and for DB to remain relevant to the trading desk. He agreed he would and despite my initial skepticism of the initial meeting as just "another sales pitch", this was backed up by the right actions. From a very small market share of FX trades in Asia, John built the relationship and significantly increased DB's share of trading volume and relevance to AB. A great communicator, with extensive product understanding and technical knowledge. John provided timely and relevant market colour and flows. He had strong relationships with traders which ensured very competitive pricing and provision of liquidity across both electronic and voice trading. He was consistent and always relevant in his coverage of the trading desk without being overbearing. John integrated well with the broader investment team at AB from portfolio managers to research professionals. This is a big gap that a lot of sales people fail to focus on. He consistently sought to bring relevant DB research and trading specialists to the office to update the AB team. These meetings were always engaging and informative and resulted in some very lively debate across both firms. Feedback from broader investment teams of John was always positive. Away from the office, he is a dedicated family man and also a mean lead singer. I would highly recommend John to any prospective employer or business partner and would happily work with him again in the future. Joseph Grise Vice President, Emerging Market Debt Trading at AllianceBernstein May 26, 2015, Joseph worked with Adrian in the same group A high impact emerging market fixed income trader with broad market experience. A collaborative team player who communicates and contributes constructively. I worked with Joe for over 3 years while at AB, with both of us part of the global EM fixed income trading group; Joe based in New York and me in Hong Kong. Over that time, we worked closely to develop greater integration between the Hong Kong and New York trading desks across Asian fixed income products in order to optimize liquidity across a 24-hour trading day in order to achieve best execution for AB’s global clients. This resulted in us passing parts of the trading book between the HK and NY desks in both primary and secondary markets and a coordinated global approach to trading Asian fixed income. We also shared market intelligence on an ongoing basis to better understand market positioning and technicals, which has benefited all global investment teams. I found Joe to be professional, highly knowledgeable in fixed income and FX markets and a strategic trader with excellent relationships with AB’s global portfolio management and research teams. I also appreciate Joe’s candor in telling things like they really are! A rare quality these days. I highly recommend Joe and would gladly work with him again if the opportunity arose.

More Actions Anastasia has a account Anastasia Savoretti Equity Derivatives Sales Trader at Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley Georgetown University - The McDonough School of Business London, United Kingdom 500+ 500+ connections Send InMail Growing up in Geneva, Switzerland and Moscow, Russia, I decided four years ago to attend an American university in order to fulfill my international background. Adapting to different cultures and situations and learning new languages such as English, Italian, Russian, and currently Spanish, in addition to my mother-tongue, French, has allowed me to view business from a truly international perspective. I differentiate myself from other candidates through my ability to quickly adapt to any environment bringing an innovative perspective that I have built my entire life. The process of learning and acquiring new skills is my passion, and I believe that the banking industry’s values and goals reflect these ambitions of mine. Throughout my work experiences, I have built a broad and well-rounded comprehension of many different industries. At my most recent summer internship, I worked at a consulting firm in Stockholm, Sweden where gathering information to create opinionated reports was key. The experience allowed me to solidify my presentation skills when sharing the reports with managing directors. Those selected skills that I have developed will, I believe, allow me to contribute significantly to my team. My interest in finance translates through my academic focus. In my Advanced Financial Management course, I have worked on a number of cases which have enabled me to develop my skills in firm valuation, taking into consideration their capital structures, agency costs, as well as their options and corporate securities. Furthermore, I have had the opportunity to apply discounted cash flows and multiple-based valuations to LBO, IPO and M&A cases. Throughout my higher education I have discovered that the ability to understand and use different financial tools whilst applying them to final valuation, has not only enabled me to form an opinion regarding firm values, but also help me form a solid interest for the industry.

The time - both professionally insofaras educating me on many aspects of the Asian equity market, it's trading and it's human dynamics, and personally, just hanging out for a beer - that he so generously showed me has been something I have been grateful for ever since as it really helped give that column an edge over competitors at the time.There are few individuals in the consulting / corporate finance landscape who have the sort of broad range of in-depth cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary skills that Bryan does. Not only is he a super-star salesman and trader, he's also very quantitatively bright and yet simultaneously understands the bigger picture of a market environment - this lends Bryan a certain air of superiority in the consulting space for sure, as well as in any general management capacity. hasn’t given any recommendations yet.

If you want to be successful in Recruiting and/or Business Development working for an agency, then you need to go the extra mile. Stay past 5 and call those candidates who couldn't get back to you during the work day. Stay late, go in early or go in on a weekend and get organized. If you've already walked out the door but a client requests to interview a candidate the following day, go back upstairs and do your best to get it scheduled. If you want your company to give you perks, then go the extra mile. If your boss asks for volunteers to reorganize the office, then volunteer. If your boss has a competition, then participate. If your boss says you can leave early, but you still have work to do, stay and do your work. Be successful and be flexible, and you'll get perks. Nothing is free, you're not entitled. Working hard creates success. Success creates perks.

Chris was one of those superiors that made you look forward to going to work everyday, especially in a sales environment. I honed a lot of my sales skills working for Chris because he knew how to bring out the best in me everyday. Knowing my background as a college baseball player, he challenged me to exceed my 'averages' and to make sure my numbers were on a steady incline. Chris also had a very ethical yet inspirational way of intertwining good ethics and faith into his tutelage of making his unit the best it could be. I would strongly recommend Chris for any Corporation or firm looking to be the best at what they do. Chris does not know anything less than extraordinary, and those are the results he achieves.

Chris was one of those superiors that made you look forward to going to work everyday, especially in a sales environment. I honed a lot of my sales skills working for Chris because he knew how to bring out the best in me everyday. Knowing my background as a college baseball player, he challenged me to exceed my 'averages' and to make sure my numbers were on a steady incline. Chris also had a very ethical yet inspirational way of intertwining good ethics and faith into his tutelage of making his unit the best it could be. I would strongly recommend Chris for any Corporation or firm looking to be the best at what they do. Chris does not know anything less than extraordinary, and those are the results he achieves.

He exercises full transparency in getting you to where you want to go.Expertise: Tom has a unique complement of business, financial market, sales and real estate experience - and he is ever current in translating and applying market conditions, trends and forecasts in the development of sound business strategies.Results: When I heard Tom earned the 2015 NJ Realtor Circle of Excellence Award, I was not surprised. Tom knows how to negotiate, navigate and close the deal in the absolute best interest of his clients. It's a privilege to recommend Tom here as a NJ Realtor Associate. Whether your interests are to buy, sell or just find out more about the market area, call Tom. Kevin Foley President and CEO at AQUA Securities August 22, 2014, Kevin was senior to Thomas but didn’t manage directly I can endorse Tom Defazio as a pioneering electronic trading salesperson with great enthusiasm. A lot of salespeople have experience persuading their prospects to do what they're already doing but switch suppliers -- whether on price, or some differentiating factor. Tom has done that but he also has invaluable experience introducing new products, which require the salesperson to convince the prospect they should stop doing what they're doing and start doing something else. That's hard to do -- you have to be diplomatic but assertive, you have to be humble but you have to have confidence in what you're presenting. Once you have experience doing that, everything else is easy. Tom has experience doing that -- to my knowledge, both at G-Trade and at Aqua. He is a diligent and thorough prospecter, he's hard-working and he's not afraid to ask for the order.

I landed on Wall Street in 1997, as a US Equity Trader for Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. In 2002, I successfully built a $20 million trading operation as Managing Director of Avalon Research, with offices in New York and Florida. Finally, I expanded the cross-branding effort between Calyon, CLSA and Cheuvreaux as VP of U.S. Equities at Calyon Securities, USA, in Research Sales & Trading. In 2007, I left the bubble of institutional sales and trading to pursue my entrepreneurial calling by developing hospitality projects in the US and abroad. In 2010, I returned to Wall Street with a different perspective and a greater appreciation for both investors and financial service professionals, recruited as a Business Development/IR partner for the top Private Wealth Management Group at RBC. But the entrepreneurial siren in me kept calling. This year, I started Numeric Trading Company with Mark Herman, a prolific and highly-regarded graphic illustrator/designer. Mark's enormous catalogue of original graphic Landmark art was the jumping off point for a multi-platform national art print and gift business - Numeric Press Limited. My many years of following and trading companies has given me great insight into building our brand and, with Mark's incredible portfolio and vision, offering design services through Numeric Design to other businesses in need of brand identity help. I remain committed to building an economy based on preservation and restoration through strategic community building investments.

As the Head of Product at Fanhattan his understanding of product requirements and user expectations are key in designing and releasing the right experience for the consumer. He has a keen eye for design and how important it is for design and product to work seamlessly and cooperatively. That collaboration is and has been critical to our success. He has great communication skills and is a pleasure to work with. He is always focused on making the product amazing for users while understanding and overcoming the internal complexities of a start-up. Gene Cook Founder & CEO @ Diana Labs, Inc. April 13, 2008, Gene managed Christophe directly Christophe is an exceptional professional and product manager. I had the pleasure of managing him while he was at eBay, and I was consistently impressed with his customer insight, absolute commitment to quality and skills in working with others. He learns extremely quickly and has an easy leadership style. I hope to have the opportunity to work with him again. Marcie Quintana Design Program Manager at Facebook June 22, 2016, Marcie worked with Christophe in the same group Marcie is a true professional, and a natural (stellar) project manager. Her attention to detail is second to none, and I was impressed by how she created efficiencies and evolved her style when needed. She has the ability to push multiple boulders uphill with a smile on her face, and can motivate people to move forward on critical items without being pushy. Her positivity is infectious and a major motivating factor to any team. I look forward to watching her career grow, and I hope I will have the opportunity to work with her again. Joshua Tabak Manages Product May 17, 2012, Christophe managed Joshua directly I hired Josh fresh out of college, and was pleasantly surprised how quickly he grew into a key contributor to the product team and influential to Fanhattan's success. He has a deep knowledge of the entertainment industry and the Fanhattan product and a tenacity for learning new things. I felt confident throwing Josh into the fire, as he quickly grasped new concepts, and took on big projects without hesitation. I look forward to watching his career grow, as I’m sure it will be one with many successes.

Expertise. Results. I've worked with Tom in several capacities over the most recent few years. He loves what he does and it shows.Integrity: Tom is a straight shooter. He exercises full transparency in getting you to where you want to go.Expertise: Tom has a unique complement of business, financial market, sales and real estate experience - and he is ever current in translating and applying market conditions, trends and forecasts in the development of sound business strategies.Results: When I heard Tom earned the 2015 NJ Realtor Circle of Excellence Award, I was not surprised. Tom knows how to negotiate, navigate and close the deal in the absolute best interest of his clients. It's a privilege to recommend Tom here as a NJ Realtor Associate. Whether your interests are to buy, sell or just find out more about the market area, call Tom. Kevin Foley President and CEO at AQUA Securities August 22, 2014, Kevin was senior to Thomas but didn’t manage directly I can endorse Tom Defazio as a pioneering electronic trading salesperson with great enthusiasm. A lot of salespeople have experience persuading their prospects to do what they're already doing but switch suppliers -- whether on price, or some differentiating factor. Tom has done that but he also has invaluable experience introducing new products, which require the salesperson to convince the prospect they should stop doing what they're doing and start doing something else. That's hard to do -- you have to be diplomatic but assertive, you have to be humble but you have to have confidence in what you're presenting. Once you have experience doing that, everything else is easy. Tom has experience doing that -- to my knowledge, both at G-Trade and at Aqua. He is a diligent and thorough prospecter, he's hard-working and he's not afraid to ask for the order.

As the Head of Product at Fanhattan his understanding of product requirements and user expectations are key in designing and releasing the right experience for the consumer. He has a keen eye for design and how important it is for design and product to work seamlessly and cooperatively. That collaboration is and has been critical to our success. He has great communication skills and is a pleasure to work with. He is always focused on making the product amazing for users while understanding and overcoming the internal complexities of a start-up. Gene Cook Founder & CEO @ Diana Labs, Inc. April 13, 2008, Gene managed Christophe directly Christophe is an exceptional professional and product manager. I had the pleasure of managing him while he was at eBay, and I was consistently impressed with his customer insight, absolute commitment to quality and skills in working with others. He learns extremely quickly and has an easy leadership style. I hope to have the opportunity to work with him again. Marcie Quintana Design Program Manager at Facebook June 22, 2016, Marcie worked with Christophe in the same group Marcie is a true professional, and a natural (stellar) project manager. Her attention to detail is second to none, and I was impressed by how she created efficiencies and evolved her style when needed. She has the ability to push multiple boulders uphill with a smile on her face, and can motivate people to move forward on critical items without being pushy. Her positivity is infectious and a major motivating factor to any team. I look forward to watching her career grow, and I hope I will have the opportunity to work with her again. Joshua Tabak Manages Product May 17, 2012, Christophe managed Joshua directly I hired Josh fresh out of college, and was pleasantly surprised how quickly he grew into a key contributor to the product team and influential to Fanhattan's success. He has a deep knowledge of the entertainment industry and the Fanhattan product and a tenacity for learning new things. I felt confident throwing Josh into the fire, as he quickly grasped new concepts, and took on big projects without hesitation. I look forward to watching his career grow, as I’m sure it will be one with many successes.

The Grenfell fire issue and they want a fresh start away from it all then I have this 2 bed unfurnished house available and happy to let them stay for a few months until they get sorted and on their feet again free of charge or if on benefits I will help sort things out. Also I will try to sort some furniture out but not sure what I can do as yet Please don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to profit at all from this and really plan selling it but happy to delay for a few months and help out if I can. I am even happy to help get the people up here if I need to. It must be awful when all of a sudden you have nothing and I always tell my kids it's nice to be nice Please get in touch if I can help Thanks Andy Ferhat liked Today is bittersweet. Today is my last day with a company that I thought I could call home for a very, very long time. No, my position is not being eliminated, my company is not closing. I made the difficult decision to move on from something that I loved. Why? Because it was killing me. Killing my work/life balance. Killing my time spent with my husband. Killing my passion for the industry that I've been successful in for well over a decade. And it's not the company's fault; its mine. For the last 15 years, I've never been able to turn myself off. I've prioritized my work over my home life. I've prioritized early mornings over late night discussions. I've prioritized long meetings over long hugs. I've prioritized deadlines over my own health. I've prioritized the short term goals over long term dreams. And then it hit me. I'm working my life away. Literally. My health has rapidly declined. I went through a divorce at age 26. I worked so many hours that I forgot my ADT code at home. I stayed at work so long that I missed my grandmothers birthday, and it was the last one she ever had. I let my job rule every decision I made. So I took back the ability to say 'No'. I took back my life and tomorrow I embark on a new journey that gives back to me. I am so grateful ❤️ Ferhat liked Looking for a striker who got enough experience to play in top level in top league in the middle east, needs to be 30 years or less, free transfer and salary budget of 500k-600k USD.

In his 1989 book “On Becoming a Leader,” Warren Bennis composed a list of the differences: – The manager administers; the leader innovates. – The manager is a copy; the leader is an original. – The manager maintains; the leader develops. – The manager focuses on systems and structure; the leader focuses on people. – The manager relies on control; the leader inspires trust. – The manager has a short-range view; the leader has a long-range perspective. – The manager asks how and when; the leader asks what and why. – The manager has his or her eye always on the bottom line; the leader’s eye is on the horizon. – The manager imitates; the leader originates. – The manager accepts the status quo; the leader challenges it. – The manager is the classic good soldier; the leader is his or her own person. – The manager does things right; the leader does the right thing."

She was able to recognise that making the change was in our best interest and it did serve us well. This strength will serve her well when she finds a positon after school becasue flexiblity is key to moving ahead and it shows a strong ability not be tied down to a decision that was off the mark.

In 2000, I was working in Bermuda as the Chief Financial Officer for a start up securities broker dealer. Kris joined our firm, initially, in a consultancy role, providing assistance and support in our back office/operations department. Kris was subsequently offered a management role in our firm overseeing new product/market development, and project managing new initiatives within the firm. Although Kris left our firm some 7 years ago to move back to NY, we have remained close.Kris is highly intelligent and has excellent analytical skills. Kris was an invaluable member of the management team during what was a very difficult “start up” phase; a phase which was marked by very rapid growth. Kris proved adaptable and always willing to take on the challenges of this environment.Since leaving Bermuda, Kris has pursued a number of avenues of study, including passing both the Level I and Level II Chartered Financial Analyst exams and pursuing a masters program in Project Management at George Washington University as well as a masters program in Computer Science at NYU.

At the time I was in the Sandton Branch and he was a part of the sales team based in Durban. Given the nature of the work at Trading Point, Ryan learned how to trade and when last I saw him he was actively trading CFD's for his own account.I would describe Ryan as an efficient and driven member of the team, although I am not so sure that remaining in sales is his destiny. He is an intelligent individual with a wealth of people skills. I would imagine that given his skill set, he'll do well in large and demanding organisation. Stephen Simms VP of Strategic Development at Northern Architectural Systems August 17, 2012, Petri managed Stephen directly Stephen Simms reported directly to me during his tenure at Investec Private Bank. He was an absolute pleasure to work with and proved himself as one of the most reliable members of my team, time and again. I would wholeheartedly recommend Stephen for any position that he may apply for as I am well aware that his abilities far exceed his experience.

At the time I was in the Sandton Branch and he was a part of the sales team based in Durban. Given the nature of the work at Trading Point, Ryan learned how to trade and when last I saw him he was actively trading CFD's for his own account.I would describe Ryan as an efficient and driven member of the team, although I am not so sure that remaining in sales is his destiny. He is an intelligent individual with a wealth of people skills. I would imagine that given his skill set, he'll do well in large and demanding organisation. Stephen Simms VP of Strategic Development at Northern Architectural Systems August 17, 2012, Petri managed Stephen directly Stephen Simms reported directly to me during his tenure at Investec Private Bank. He was an absolute pleasure to work with and proved himself as one of the most reliable members of my team, time and again.

This is a question I have received not once, but seven times today. So here we go. I preface this sappy little rant by stating the fact that I am not drunk (yet..lol). "Attention is the most important currency that anybody can give you. It's worth more than money, possessions or things." (Steve Rubell) I don't work for Amazon, Walmart or Lowe's. I work for Wipes.com, a much smaller company (for now at least). My job is to sell wipes. I could clock in everyday, make a few phone calls to sell wipes and clock out. I choose to take it to the next level and "sell" (provide) a clean, safe and healthy environment for your staff and customers. I am vulnerable and put myself out here so you can "see" who I really am instead of just a name at the end of an email. If you have followed my posts you have seen that I have been called just another pretty face and attacked by trolls. I have also met thousands of great people. So to fully answer this question. I choose to have 30,000 + LI connections because it brings attention to my company, I have met some of the most influential people of my life on here, received helpful advice, some great sales, three marriage proposals and I have a ton of fun! Next question. Avital liked Turkey more than 3x the OECD average. Wow. Avital liked a comment BlackRock : to Take a Minority Equity Stake in Digital Investment Manager Scalable Capital | 4-Traders Avital liked Shocker alert ! “Oleg, my boss keeps telling me I work for him, and that’s how he introduces me to other people. I saw a post recently by someone else which said this is a bad form. Do you agree ?” Yes, it is a bad form of leadership – it is driven either by own insecurity or the need to dominate. Let’s be clear. We work for a cause, for a purpose, WITH colleagues. I have never told anyone they work for me, let alone introduce them as such to someone else. This form is denigrating, dehumanizing and outdated. While we on the subject of dehumanizing terms, I never refer to people as resources either. To me a coffee machine or a printer is a resource, people are colleagues and team members. Your manager should really read one of my articles, such as this to start: https://lnkd.in/dtqSBUr Avital liked Why has Shipping got it so wrong ? Avital liked ‪George H.W.

This is a question I have received not once, but seven times today. So here we go. I preface this sappy little rant by stating the fact that I am not drunk (yet..lol). "Attention is the most important currency that anybody can give you. It's worth more than money, possessions or things." (Steve Rubell) I don't work for Amazon, Walmart or Lowe's. I work for Wipes.com, a much smaller company (for now at least). My job is to sell wipes. I could clock in everyday, make a few phone calls to sell wipes and clock out. I choose to take it to the next level and "sell" (provide) a clean, safe and healthy environment for your staff and customers. I am vulnerable and put myself out here so you can "see" who I really am instead of just a name at the end of an email. If you have followed my posts you have seen that I have been called just another pretty face and attacked by trolls. I have also met thousands of great people. So to fully answer this question. I choose to have 30,000 + LI connections because it brings attention to my company, I have met some of the most influential people of my life on here, received helpful advice, some great sales, three marriage proposals and I have a ton of fun! Next question. Avital liked Turkey more than 3x the OECD average. Wow. Avital liked a comment BlackRock : to Take a Minority Equity Stake in Digital Investment Manager Scalable Capital | 4-Traders Avital liked Shocker alert ! “Oleg, my boss keeps telling me I work for him, and that’s how he introduces me to other people. I saw a post recently by someone else which said this is a bad form. Do you agree ?” Yes, it is a bad form of leadership – it is driven either by own insecurity or the need to dominate. Let’s be clear. We work for a cause, for a purpose, WITH colleagues. I have never told anyone they work for me, let alone introduce them as such to someone else. This form is denigrating, dehumanizing and outdated. While we on the subject of dehumanizing terms, I never refer to people as resources either. To me a coffee machine or a printer is a resource, people are colleagues and team members. Your manager should really read one of my articles, such as this to start: https://lnkd.in/dtqSBUr Avital liked Why has Shipping got it so wrong ? Avital liked ‪George H.W.

I am in awe of how much Jan is aware of not only her clients' needs but she is also genuinely concerned about finding the right candidates the perfect opportunity. Her dedication is remarkable and unwavering. I am sure that Jan was dealing with many qualified candidates but I always felt that I was her top priority. She never fails to return a call or e-mail. Jan feels that she has a good day when she is able to help her clients find good and talented employees. It should also be noted that Jan cares deeply about her community.

I am honored to write a recommendation for such a professional and courteous individual. This is the second time over the course of my career that I have reached out to Jan after a reduction in staff. I am in awe of how much Jan is aware of not only her clients' needs but she is also genuinely concerned about finding the right candidates the perfect opportunity. Her dedication is remarkable and unwavering. I am sure that Jan was dealing with many qualified candidates but I always felt that I was her top priority. She never fails to return a call or e-mail. Jan feels that she has a good day when she is able to help her clients find good and talented employees. It should also be noted that Jan cares deeply about her community. She often volunteers at the Pine Street Inn, more often than not giving up her Christmas to help others in need.

He knows how to walk the extra mile and he is a powerful motivator for those who work with him.I always trusted Jeremy's word and I can confirm he is extremely professional. Ashirayi Makosienyi MBA, ACMA, ACCA Chartered Management Accountant I Senior Finance Professional I Finance Manager February 17, 2016, Jérémy worked with Ashirayi in the same group At a professional level, Jeremy has deep financial intelligence especially on treasury, forex and transaction structuring. It is possibly as a result of his experience and education that he can think on his feet and make well measured finance decisions on complex matters that may well need significant “thinking time”. As a manager, he has the ability to identify and nature talent, yet without hesitation to reprimand poor performance. At a personal level, Jeremy combines great listening skills and decisiveness. He is business minded, driven, with an ability to tactfully handle dissenting views to achieve optimal outcomes. Anne de Terssac, CFA Fixed Income Portfolio Manager February 17, 2016, Jérémy managed Anne directly I have been working with Anne for 1 year when she was a trainee on my desk. She was able to deal with the pressure of our activity without any problem.She had a very positive approach with our customers and were able to provide very good services (she is technical, efficient and with a very good sense of commerce).I would recommend Anne de Terssac for sure and remain at the disposal of anyone who would like to ask more precise questions. Gustavo Liberali Managing Partner at F3 Capital Management February 28, 2013, Gustavo worked with Jérémy in the same group I had the opportunity to work with Gustavo during a while. I keep this period in mind because it was very interesting and helpful to work with him. Gustavo is clever and knows perfectly how to explain stuff to be understood by everyone. It was a great pleasure to share some working months with him and I highly recommend him for any job linked to his skills.

Morgan Stanley reckon "the recovery is broadening, with more engines of growth across countries and sectors", and as a result have raised their 2017 GDP forecast by 10 basis points to 1.9%. Expectations that 2017 could lead to a greater recovery are increasing, with big implications on regional stocks, backed up by national indices in Germany, Italy and France, all up more than the main US benchmark. Karen Olney, an Equity Strategist at UBS, agreed saying, "equities will continue to be re-energised if [the ECB’s] stimulus tapering commences as planned, pointing to higher rates, and the euro area continues to normalise." #SpartanInternational Tom liked Look what I found this morning?
