See moreSee more of undefined summary Highlights Follow Follow {:entityName} Paul Simon’s Articles & Activity 3,160 followers BPAAS levers for U.S Health Plans targeting Hispanic Americans Paul Simon Arakkal on LinkedIn See all articles GDP by state growth ranged from 3.4 percent in Texas to 0.1 percent in Kansas and Mississippi. Finance and insurance; retail trade; and professional, scientific, and technical services were the leading contributors to U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter. Overall, growth was pretty even when states are combined to regions. The GDP share of those regions didn't change much, comparing year-over-year fourth quarter figures. As shown in the Statista chart below, the GDP has a strong correlation with how many people live in those areas. It doesn’t come as much of a surprise that the Southeast, which has the combined population of 12 states, amounting to approximately 83 million (or a quarter of U.S. citizens), also has the biggest GDP share, standing at 21.4 percent of total GDP. The thinly populated Rocky Mountain area (12 million inhabitants) has a share of 3.4 percent of the GDP. Paul Simon shared this Among women who take maternity leave, higher-income mothers take twice as much leave, on average, as lower-income moms. Among parents who took leave following the birth or adoption of a child in the past two years, mothers took a median of 11 weeks, while fathers took a median of one week. However, the amount of maternity leave taken varies by income. Higher-income mothers (those with household incomes of $75,000 or higher) typically take longer maternity leaves than mothers with incomes under $30,000 (12 weeks vs. six weeks). Paul Simon shared this CAR registrations in Europe have moved into the fast lane. In March 1.9m cars were registered on the continent, a rise of 10.8% compared with the same month a year ago, according to JATO, an industry analyst. Europe overtook its previous record for March and slipped past America to become the world’s second-biggest car market, behind China. Five big countries accounted for 1.5m vehicle registrations between them. Registrations in Germany jumped by 11.4%, to 360,000. Those in Italy soared by 17.4%, to 227,000, as its economy, along with others in southern Europe, continued to catch up with the north. Britain also had a bumper month, registering 562,000 cars, 8.4% more than in March of last year. Government incentives (and in some cases impending tax rises) played a part, as did rising consumer confidence. Figures for the first quarter were up in all but one country, Ireland, compared with a year earlier.

I had an opportunity to work with him closly for almost an year and every interaction with him was full of learning (I used to work out of his cabin, so I could actually spend more than 9-10 hours a day in observing & Learning from him).He is a visionary and dynamic leader who empowers his team and propels his organization to achieve outstanding results. He is not only Super in Sales & Marketing, he has been a great Delivery Leader as well......... in his leadership all his teams broke all their previous perfomance records/benchmarks.A very honest gentleman with higest level of integrity coupled with rare combination of brilliance, humility, pragmatism, and friendliness which is hard to find in most leaders today. Paul always recommends/encourages and himself takes "Right Decisions" (which need not be the most popular ones).Paul values and gives great attention to every relationship (either Business/Personal) that he creates, For example; He would know names of most of the people in his team (I am talking about 700-800 People). He is great joy to work with, a joy to do brainstorm with, and a joy to watch at his work. Paul poses an exceptional mix of business and technical intellect that create an aura of inspiration for all who surround him.It took me long time ( Couple of Years) just to articulate few things that I know about this great personality which otherwise would actually run into pages if I eloborate :-)You are the Best PaulRegardsAyiaz View 18 more recommendations View 18 more recommendations recommendations Blair Bass Practice Leader - Aerospace & Defense Industry at Charles Aris Inc.

When I was offered a new Territory, my employer asked me to find a replacement that could build on my success and continue the growth of sales in the Virginia and West Virginia region. Having spent over twenty years in this industry, and ten years with my employer, I had hundreds of potential candidates to choose from. Rick Bartels distinguished himself as a bright, aggressive, knowledgeable and detail oriented sales professional with the skills and inherent abilities required for the position. Rick stood leagues apart from any other potential candidate, was ultimately chosen for the position and quickly proved himself to be a leading Territory Manager. Rick’s natural ability to develop relationships built on trust, combined with his strong product knowledge and friendly personality, propelled him to the top of his field. My endorsement of Rick is with strong conviction, based on his proven success and combined with positive feedback from my former clients who have found working with Rick to be a true pleasure. Rick is truly one of a kind and should be considered a valuable asset to any company.

Ni tänker säkert på loadtime som ett tekniskt KPI men i själva verket är det ett affärs KPI. Det är först då, ni kommer få verklig förbättring av er loadtime. när ni vet att ledningen tittar.

Their group of engineers were in need of some manufacturing capabilities for a new customer and I needed their expertise to start the business.

There help launched our JV which later they took ownership of in their new facility. Shoun Kerbaugh Managing Director at PiTTek - A Division of Swindell Dressler International March 6, 2010, Shoun was a client of Jeffrey’s I cannot recommend anyone more highly than Shoun Kerbaugh for a senior management position requiring a world-class strategist and leader, the model of a skilled professional. People seek out Shoun to work with, because of his infectious enthusiasm and drive to achieve outstanding results. While the Siemens Metals business in the US was still in its infancy we teamed with SMS for expansion plans into the N. American market. Shoun acted as US Sales Manager at SMS and I provided technical sales account management services from Siemens which was the start of a 20 year business relationship. We were able to form a most successful team for complex industrial project business which launched Nucor into the leading steel producer it is today.He is a true professional in every sense of the word. He is extremely adept at building relationships in a positive way and leveraging those relationships for other's benefit. In working with Shoun, I have observed firsthand his professionalism, exceptional people and technical skills. His win-win collaborative mindset, attention to detail, and consistent problem solving skills always won him the respect of both his colleagues and his customers. He is one of the hardest working people I know and he somehow always makes time for everyone whether it is a customer, partner or colleague. It has truly been a pleasure for him to ask me for my endorsement.

Having someone with Graeme's experience and ability enabled us to move from a situation where we were doing low value 'body-shopping' type of work with our client to securing a 5 year Managed Service deal at an appropriate margin.Graeme is a great guy and easy to work with. He did a great job of building a close relationship with the main client buyer and influencer. It was clear to me that Graeme really built up trust and understanding with the client. Graeme created an environment where the client felt they could do business with us and this was no mean feat given that they were finding it difficult to move forward just 4 months earlier.In my role as a Solution Architect I particularly appreciated the way that Graeme was prepared to listen to comments, questions, suggestions and concerns about the deal and our overall approach and commercials. If Graeme wasn't clear or didn't understand he would go back over it or ask to come back to it at a suitable moment. Once he understood the point and the facts he would make a decision and move on.The team environment that Graeme created proves that an open, collaborative and teaming approach can deliver a great result. It's testament to the job Graeme and the team did that we were able to close a significant piece of business, with a new client, at target margin. Sharon Bate Kucukhaci Director, Contracts Management Lead of Business Process Outsourcing, UKI at Accenture October 27, 2014, Sharon Bate worked with Graeme in different groups I have worked with Graeme on a couple of large deal pursuits over the past few years.Graeme is a very experienced sales professional and he established a strong pursuit team that he managed in an open and honest manner fostering a real team environment with no hidden agendas. Each team member was encouraged to continually and constructively challenge each other professionally to develop the best solution for both Accenture and the Client.Graeme's manner, demeanour and approach enables him to develop influential relationships with the Client which resulted in the successful sale. This approach also establishes trust and respect across the Accenture team who will support his leadership and direction. When working with Graeme I have always received positive feedback for the contribution I have provided. I always thoroughly enjoy working with Graeme and wouldn't have any hesitation supporting Graeme on other sales opportunities as I'm confident he will establish a great team that will always deliver success, and he's also good fun and keeps me smiling even under some challenging circumstances.

I really value Andrew’s constructive challenge and find him an ideal sounding board and contributor to deal tactics and strategy.Andrew can be relied upon to pull all the necessary internals together (across delivery, off-shore and finance) and ensure that all the “i”’s have been dotted and the “t”’s crossed to ensure the solution is deliverable and the company is protected. This same attention to detail helps to ensure that any materials we prepare for the client are thorough, accurate and stand up to any scrutiny.Andrew is a pleasure to work with. He’s proactive, dependable, hard-working, responsive, accurate, knowledgeable and a good team player. In an ideal world I would have Andrew on every pursuit I work on. David Mather Senior Director, Strategic Global Alliances October 3, 2010, David worked with Graeme in the same group David’s unswerving professionalism impressed me during the time we worked together at Accenture. He’s hard working, conscientious, creative and quickly develops strong relationships with clients and colleagues alike.

He is intelligent, hard-working, has very strong SQL and Excel skills and is very warm and approachable. Ant could be counted on to cover regression cycles and testing of fixes and enhancements that were technically difficult, demanding and in-depth (and time-constrained). He would often work late to meet deadlines if required. He was well organised, and helpful and got on very well with Business Analysts, Developers, PMs, Support and other QA team members.

Yulia was a focused, driven learner, eager to grow in her professional knowledge-base, yet already possessing deep skills and a keen, insightful mind. Her knowledge of international trade issues and global entreprise made me wish that she was working for us in our rural corner of the state! Gina Ossian Independent Beachbody Coach September 27, 2010, Gina worked with Paul in the same group Gina and I worked together on two major projects which took us from impoverished Chicago-area communities to the dramatic eastern mountains of China... during that time, she was a serious, organized professional who tempered her work ethic and GTD approach with a warm personality and a great sense of humor. I always looked forward to collaborating with Gina because I knew we'd deliver the goods and smile while we were doing it.

Een student werkt op een school waar veel aandacht is voor differentiëren. Ze doet een pilot met een digitale methode die zegt optimale ondersteuning te bieden bij differentiëren. De bedoeling van haar praktijkonderzoek is om de schoolleiding een onderbouwd advies te geven om deze methode aan te gaan schaffen of niet. Ze is eerst gaan uitzoeken welke vormen van differentiëren er beschikbaar zijn voor haar lespraktijk. Daarna is ze gaan kijken welke vormen de digitale methode ondersteunt. Ze vindt 15 verschillende mogelijke vormen van differentiëren voor haar vak. De digitale methode biedt ondersteuning bij 2 daarvan. De leerlingen maken slechts gebruik van 1 vorm. Daarover is ze overigens wel heel tevreden en haar leerlingen ook. Het feit dat de digitale methode slechts een beperkt aantal vormen van differentiatie ondersteunt leidt tot het advies aan de schoolleiding om niet louter de digitale methode aan te schaffen, maar om vooral te investeren in het eigen maken van de overige 13 vormen van differentiëren. Mooie ontwikkeling. Guy liked 5 mei, vrije dag, heerlijke dag om achterstallig nakijkwerk weg te werken. Het begint al goed. Lees ik dit echt? Ja, het staat er echt: 'het doel van dit onderzoek is om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden'. Geniaal. Ik ben benieuwd wat voor briljante inzichten ik nog meer ga tegenkomen vandaag.

Indien ze een probleem denkt te zien aankomen gaat ze al pro-actief op zoek naar een oplossing en laat ook zien wat er gaat gebeuren als er niet wordt ingegrepen. Ondanks het part-time werken weet ze altijd op tijd de zaken geregeld te krijgen. Oftewel een aanwinst voor elke bedrijf dat gaat voor kwaliteit en collegialiteit.

Dit is prettig voor zowel zijn klanten als collega's, omdat iedereen weet wat de gemaakte afspraken zijn. Daarbij is hij prettig in de omgang en kan hij zich goed aanpassen aan zijn gesprekspartner. Mark is een teamplayer die echter ook prima in staat is om zelf beslissingen te nemen, waarbij hij het bedrijfsbelang niet uit het oog verliest.

Roque grew our sales team and our revenue line to and through a successful acquisition by Intel Corporation. Three of Roque's greatest traits - Presence, Passion, and Perspective. He has the presence to capture the attention and mindshare of his team and the customers he engages. His passion pours out of his pores. He's constantly thinking about how to compete, how to reach the customer, and how to inspire the team. He's non-stop and enthusiastic. He works hard to develop interesting perspectives that allow him to engage and converse with anyone. He's an exceptional listener when it comes to identifying customer pains and the real issues in a sales cycle.

Charlee joined Damteq as its first full time employee and brought with her a forward-thinking attitude and work ethic better than I ever expected. Giving Charlee lists of tasks within a week of joining, Charlee proactively managed her own time, contributing massively to the business from every angle, constantly thinking outside the box to improve not only our own marketing strategy, but also our clients. Joining such a small business it can feel daunting working so closely to the company director, however Charlee broke the 'awkward silence' straight away by coming up with ideas to improve our communication which was fantastic, these procedures are still helping the business today. Throughout Charlee's time at Damteq she completed projects on time and never failed to add that needed creative touch where appropriate. With a world class writing skill, I still get feedback from our clients today about how fantastic Charlee's work was. I would highly recommend Charlee to any potential employer as she naturally rises to the occasion when presented with any project, regardless of whether she is personal interested in it or not. Rebecca Cave Content & Copywriting Lead at Gattaca December 9, 2012, Adam managed Rebecca directly Thank you so much for your creative writing so far.

MIKE commented BASEBALL—I managed from T-ball through 16 YO. My preseason speech was always "I don’t enjoy losing by 20 runs and I don’t enjoy winning by 20 runs either." Respect all! Anyone who coaches and enjoys pummeling a bunch of 10 or 12 year old kids really should go get some professional help. MIKE liked Are you where you need to be? Last week I talked to a small group of firefighters, who shared with me that they were very lucky to be part of a fire department that still was offering a pension, in this case paying them 60% of their present salary. Many FD’s doesn’t have that option. BUT, here is my question “Can you sustain your present lifestyle on 60% of your income”? Know your options!
