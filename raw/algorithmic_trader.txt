My MS concentrations are Artificial Intelligence and Computer Systems. My undergraduate degree is in Management Science & Engineering with a specialization in Financial & Decision Analysis. I have an intimate background with financial modeling and have a significant amount of work experience in equity research. My work experience includes significant work designing distributed efficiency-crucial data analytics tools in the realm of quantitative trading. I suppose this would fall into the realm of the colloquial "big" data. My programming background includes significant experience with C, C++, Python, Ruby, and Java. I also have a familiarity with JavaScript, C# and Lua. I primarily use Python for any analytics work. I have non-trivial experience using Python with Numpy/Scipy, Theano, sklearn and CVXPY.

I never looked for colleagues that just know, but mostly those that can learn more and teach me more. Let's be eager to learn all life to share openly and foster change. Hope I can give back at least a fraction of all you taught me and still teach me. #FinTech change is now! btw great fresco at IBM Studio in #Singapore Joshua liked It was a pleasure presenting at QuantCon this year. I was humbled by the number of questions and follow-ups from the audience. My talk was a summary of the recent changes we've experienced in the HFT space, addressing popular headlines about the industry and more. For those who missed the conference, recordings are available online through the QuantCon website. (I have no financial stake in this - the talks are seriously good and worth a watch.)

He knows exactly what his strengths are and leverages them to the hilt. And his latest venture is a testimony to the conviction and confidence he has - rare commodities in the financial markets. Vivek Khanna Head of Operations September 30, 2008, Vivek and Manish were students together To me, Manish Jalan epitomises Energy. Whatever he does he adds passion to it. Whether he does dram or for that matter anything. He is ambitious, hard working and truthful by nature. I have seen him leading in various positions at IIT in exemplary manner. He is in Mumbai with his startup, and I am sure his persistence and dedication will make it a resounding success. View 2 more recommendations View 2 more recommendations recommendations Amit Upadhyay VP Engineering at Coverfox September 30, 2008, Manish and Amit were students together Amit is one of the finest brains in software industry today. He is a geek, a nerd who drinks and sleeps on software codes. Dont be surprised if he talks to you casually and gets words like, "slow cpu", "memory loss", "you don't boot well with me", "your system crashes when I explain you something", "linux and my Girl Friend rocks" in his day-to-day conversations. He is a magician on the net and a very simple down-to-earth guy, away from his keyboard. Entrepreneurship runs in his veins (don't believe me? Check out Vakow.com, which he has built single-handedly). Always a delight to be in his company and hang around with him. Good that I am in Mumbai - I get to meet this nerd quite often these days. Ashwin Parthasarathy Innovation | Product Strategy | Technology Leadership September 30, 2008, Manish reported directly to Ashwin Ok, its 11 pm at night we are leaving the office - waving good night to Ashwin. I ask, "Aren't you leaving Ashwin?", and pat comes the answer - "Dude have to finish this design before the sun dawns and assign work tomorrow, so having a Night-Out". Such is the dedication towards computers this gizmo-geek has!! He is one of the few managers with whom you can play foos-ball, go for pizzas, burgers, bunk offices for movies (at times), and still get your work done to perfection, on-time and beyond expectations. His software skills are unparalleled and leadership qualities is unmatched. Really loved to work with him at Aditi.

Watching your code make money is more fun. Watching your code saving people, a lot of time, is even more fun. The bliss is, watching your dad play with your son.I took a risk, when I shifted back home to live with my parents. I had plans, back up of plans and back up of back ups, some worked, some didn't. The last three years have been a roller coaster ride, trying to start a school, doing high frequency start-up, understanding agriculture and learning a lot about myself. As of now, I don't know what the future would bring, but whatever be the result, I am sure, the decision was the best I've ever made.For the most part, I am an engineer at heart. I am fascinated by automation tasks and applied mathematics. I can add a lot of value if you have a lot of time consuming tasks and want to scale systems. For the remaining part, I love kids and I like to teach. I am a part-time teacher teaching high school students problem solving.I love to come up with efficient algorithms and solving mathematical problems. If I were to choose one thing, I am good at, I would defend this. Designing simulations, protocols and data formats, comes quite naturally.At the implementation end, I am quite proficient with C++, Shell script and Perl, with years of experience. Networks, Databases and intricacies of Linux are good too. I used to have a pretty good hand at Java, but haven't used it much for five years, so brushing it up a little bit. I have introductory experience with web-stacks, mostly core Javascript and python with mysql as backend.I have four years of experience in equities and futures, high frequency trading and I understand the systems quite thoroughly. I excel at optimizing strategies, optimize models and have real fun taking them to newer markets.I am looking for projects requiring about 40-50 hrs a week, working from remote location.

Mentor at Algorithmic Traders Association July 26, 2016, Dani was a client of Alex‚Äôs During the last 17 years of trading , I've seen many so-called traders with lots of black box systems that don't perform well when tested. Also, i never understood why should someone agree to sell his profiting methods.Alex is the real thing. He will teach you the tools you need so you could continue to develop on your own. No holy grail and no promise for systems that work. Instead you will acquire the skills to test everything , that your creativity and experience will take you to, on your own with simple coding (I've never coded before the course) and using affordable technologies .Alex will teach you ways to research for robust systems , understand the pitfalls and the risks and build your confidence in your own ideas.Highly recommended.

I have always enjoyed growing with people. I have been trusted by my mentor and I have trusted those whom I have worked with. I was the youngest to earn a partnership in my firm and I was fiercely loyal to my mentor.In my first job after college, I setup a algorithmic trading system in a team of three. We were fortunate to add a great group of college grads with fresh ideas and energy, and together we setup one of the most successful algo-trading groups in the world. Those trading strategies (and their offshoots in three other firms as people moved) cover a large part of high frequency futures and forex trading today. I worked on everything in this process, but being a CS guy I'd like to highlight two areas:(1) machine learning, optimization, learning but not overfitting data (is there anything more difficult than not overfitting!)(2) low latency systems, efficient algorithms, test-driven development, networking, data-engineering infrastructureThe financial success allowed me to become an entrepreneur. It's not easy in finance! Due to the awesome intellect and work of the team at the companies I have setup since then, we have been able to execute very well.With more maturity I felt the need to have a greater impact on the real investor, be it the endowment fund or the real-money investor at home.

Interesting that 16 meetings would have been a good goal for the day before the intensive coaching popped it up into the low 30s. Now I'm spoiled and looking forward to a bit of list refresh to take us back to that level. Someone made a great point in a recent comment - that you need to treat these things statistically and not react to a single day. Given my physics/math background, I am very sympathetic to that point of view. However, when you're running at 5000+ dials in a day, waiting for a week is not statistically sensible. The data in this chart would be statistically meaningful for a set of 3 million dials - except those dials are not independent trials. It's like driving a car in traffic - where you are on average doesn't count as much as all the little adjustments and reactions you must execute in order to arrive alive. With ConnectAndSell, you are finally going fast enough to be able to "drive" - which brings with it the responsibility to actually drive!

Setting up an algorithmic trading environment is a highly demanding technological endeavor that needs excellent technical and organizational skills, perseverance, a can-do mindset, precision and total dedication. James gets the job done. Stephen Parkins Startup CEO, Entrepreneur, Trader May 22, 2016, Stephen worked with James in the same group I worked next to Stephen while at Axpo Trading AG, Stephen was the fundamental trader whilst I was investigating the algorithmic trading of Oil products. Stephen deeply dedicates himself to fundamental research, spending the time necessary to understand all the varying views, modelling scenarios and weighing the hard fundamental data. His approach paid off in terms of profitable results, sitting next to him I also learnt a great deal about how Oil fundamentals and macroeconomics drive the market. I would highly recommend him for any trading related roles.

Co-founder & Director of GTP Talent Search February 27, 2017, Robert was a client of Polly‚Äôs I recommend Polly Chan quite highly as a recruiter for technically skilled people looking for advanced positions suited to their skills, temperament, and ambitions. I had not placed myself in the open job market for many years, but very shortly after posting my full profile on linked in, I received a polite inquiry from Polly. Despite the time-zone differences, Polly made it very easy to connect and she and her associates spent quite a bit of time interviewing me, discussing my background, skills, areas of interest, (and disinterest), really making an accurate assessment of the product they were trying to place. This contrasts with the usual case wherein a recruiter sees my profile and spams me with job offers with modest key-word-matches, or takes one word on my resume as defining the totality of what I have to contribute. Instead, Polly and her associates gave time and consideration as to which positions seems the most likely to provide a fruitful match for all concerned. And I say that even though I ended up taking a different job; that was merely fortuitous ... if it hadn't come up, the greatest likelihood was going to be that one of Polly's proposals was going to be a fit. In short, my experience with Polly and her team was perfect, I have nothing to complain about, nothing to warn you about, and only my strongest suggestion that you work with Polly if you get the chance. Alex Haluska Senior Consultant January 17, 2017, Robert was a client of Alex‚Äôs My experience working with Alex as a recruitment prospect has been excellent. Of course we prospects are the commodity in this situation, but Alex never lets you feel that way. He's conscientious, takes time to connect with you, is timely in his follow-ups, and has a core of personal integrity that makes the whole process that much easier. Thanks Alex.

He is organized and works thoroughly (yet efficiently) which is much appreciated by all colleagues. His ability to foresee problems or spot flaws in early project plans has often saved time and money. Olle stresses the importance of team spirit and acts accordingly with great generosity.It is a true privilege to work with or alongside Olle Pellijeff. Peter McPhee Sales Director at Itiviti AB September 4, 2007, Olle worked with Peter in the same group I worked with Olle while he was based in our Sydney office as Senior Software Developer of Orc's high end algo trading platform - Liquidator. He lived close by and we enjoyed quite a few nights out boozing/playing pool at the local pub. Olle's not too good at pool, but he's a great guy, extremely intelligent and a pleasure to work with.It was no surprise (sadly for Orc) that he was poached by a very large European Hedge Fund, who are now one of the largest volume players in the Asian markets, to join them as their CTO.

His background of growing up in Malaysia and studying in England made his a very valuable bridge between western employees and the local culture.While at the research lab Edward showed great technical knowledge while working on advanced wireless terminal development, but even more importantly he was a great communicator and good at managing our client contacts in the region.

In this bank I made a various and interesting experience in the last five years. My activities includes option market making (I obtained the licence for market making activities on IDEM market), basket trading, co-integration trading, statistical arbitrages, with focus on the equity and derivatives markets (but I followed also bond markets). I personally started a new way to trade in this bank, introducing the algorithmic trading. This activity for me included the whole process for the realization of an automated trading strategy: the idea, the study of the market behaviour, the simulation/backtesting, the development and the go-live. In order to develop this kind of business I had to empower my programming skills, in particular actually I‚Äôm very active with Java. I also developed a knowledge of the networking and hardware aspects. After the first successful activities we expanded our activities on the Eurex market and the Spanish derivatives market MEFF. Regarding the MEFF, I have been the direct project manager responsible for the connection and the start-up activities for this market. In these years for our activities I had to employ and test many softwares. I started developing on RTS RTD/Tango with its own language. Then we moved to Orc Liquidator, with the possibility to develop strategies in Java code. Actually I am very experienced with the Orc platform. I‚Äôve tested also other trading softwares like FastTrack and GateLab, so I am very experienced in the connectivity and trading solutions. Thereby now I am responsible for the design and involved in the development of a custom trading platform. I joined other projects with them or other colleagues of the Risk Management and Back Office, in order to improve all the activities connected with our business.

He had useful insights into the days events and also a great handle on how that fit into the bigger picture. He was great at fitting the pieces of the puzzle together and interpreting what impact these pieces might have in the future as well. Mickel Abdelkodous Systems Engineer at RSA October 6, 2009, Bradley worked with Mickel in different groups Mickel was by far the most reliable support team member at Gelber. Whenever I had a problem, big or small, he took the time to come over fix it and follow up. He also made sure to FIX the problem, instead of going with a quick-fix, band aid approach that would create further problems down the road.

He did so well that a team of around six other students formed a collusion network to try to beat him. If Alan were a contract, I'd be long him. Hyungsok Ahn . February 25, 2010, Hyungsok worked with Alan in different groups Alan joined Nomura's equity derivatives trading team in Hong Kong as an exotic derivative trader, when Nomura was building the equity structured product business in Asia (excluding Japan). At that time, I was the head of quants, who is responsible for quantitative models and technology infrastructure globally.I remember that he was very inquisitive about the details of the quantitative models and methodologies I used, in the level where most of the traders do not have clear understanding, which reveals that he had an excellent insight on various concepts in quantitative principle. I was able to recognize that he had a right aptitude for trading exotic derivatives as it crucial to perceive the complexity of the risk in the instruments he trade correctly, and that he was a conscientious practitioner. This was very encouraging, because the more a person learns about what I do, the better he understands the amount of effort I put. I did appreciated a lot of intellectual conversations we had.Nomura's business in Hong Kong was developed rapidly and was very successful and promising. It was astonishing that it was achieved by such a small number of people in such a short time. Alan's intelligence and passion for success contributed to this largely. Alan is very personable, which I should emphasize as much as his talent. I strongly recommend him.

Doug ran and created many profitable grey box and black box strategies during his time at Allston and was a key member to a team that was highly profitable. I would consider Doug an expert in market analysis and quite able to take his knowledge and create profitable strategies around those observations. Besides his expertise in the markets, Doug is a great person. Doug made it enjoyable to come to work each day and as a result people on the team looked up to Doug in a leadership capacity.

I witnessed his success in 1999 but more importantly his move to cash in March of 2000. What differentiates Bob from others is his data integrity. That includes disproving some of his own theories. Most would just change the input to get their desired output. Bob is brutally honest and that skill set enables him to outlast other investors.

I was lucky enough to meet Josh in 2009, and immediately hired him after the culmination of one (albeit long) discussion. Josh‚Äôs knowledge base combines the principles of risk management with the tactical ability of being able to quickly program and implement a solution or strategy. Josh's deep understanding of both market risk and technology risk allowed our team to compete against teams that were 100 times our size in personnel, and many orders of magnitude larger with respect to financial and monetary resources. I would gladly work with Josh again, and I have no doubt that he will continue to provide exceptional value to any team who is lucky enough to acquire him. Adam Hoffman Founder and Managing Member at Wooded Park Strategies, LLC October 7, 2016, Adam managed Joshua directly I met Joshua after he started his associate rotation at the Royal Bank of Canada while I was managing the Algorithmic Process Trading Desk at RBC taking pure proprietary risk, and after speaking with him for 45 minutes and hearing his story as well as his hunger and obvious grit, I hired him immediately into my group by the end of the interview (the first and only time I have done this to date). Josh served as my second in command responsible for not only creating and monitoring of our entire algorithmic trading process (all of our trading and risk strategies), but also for the development of new strategies that proved crucial to our continued success and survival in an geometrically growing market place with respect to the competition we continually faced. Josh came with me to Millennium Partners where he was part of my team that had a Sharpe Ratio of 4+ which was incredibly difficult to achieve. He then came with me to Falconwood / Gresham where I formally made him the COO of my team. I know we wouldn‚Äôt have gotten as far as we did and achieved the results that we achieved without Josh‚Äôs contributions, and his ability to work and deliver under some of the highest pressure situations I can imagine in this business. I would like to say I was surprised by his achievements, but I was not. His combat tour in the Middle East during an exceptionally long war prepared him and honed his exceptional discipline. Any team, irrespective of the space involved, would be lucky to have him on their team. hasn‚Äôt given any recommendations yet.

Yonatan Lerner Solution Architect @ Teradata May 1, 2014, Spenser was a client of Yonatan‚Äôs Yonatan is extremely knowledgeable about building a Customer Success Management function. He shared his best practices on how to build a successful CSM organization. He also provided prescriptive steps for Amplitude we could immediately apply to create a high performing team. Before working with Yonatan, we didn't realize how much of a difference a well built success process would create Amplitude's customers. Since then, we've built our CSM process around his recommendations and it's made a huge difference for all of our new customers.

More Actions David has a account David Adler ... Eldorado Trading Group University of Michigan Chicago, Illinois 426 426 connections Connect Pending Invitation Sent I'm a professional trader specializing in Eurodollar Futures on Globex (Chicago Mercantile Exchange). Most of my trading is intra-day and focused in the Eurodollar outrights and various calendar- and butterfly spread combinations where I make fully discretionary trades based on pricing discrepancies and observation of price action, order flow, and steepening/flattening of the yield curve, ultimately governed by fundamental expectations of Fed policy.I interact with the market by traditional 'point-and-click', generally using limit orders to which I attach custom automated processes in order to minimize price slippage, as my core strategy is extremely price-sensitive. I trade with custom technology that I designed and built with the help of six software engineers with a combined 75 years of FinTech experience and a small group of professional traders with a combined 100+ years of experience trading futures on Globex. I'm a CME member and a member of Eldorado Trading Group, a group of independent traders like myself who engage with the financial markets on a daily basis and share an office in the Chicago Loop where we exchange research and development and share back office operations, among other resources. I'm always interested in exploring opportunities with talented Data Scientists, Software Engineers, Academics, and Entrepreneurs.If you are a Data Scientist with 2+ years of experience with Python or R and are interested in getting involved with Capital Markets or in working with high resolution market data, please reach out to me by private message.

They fail to understand that some of us are into technology for the love of it, not to primarily become unicorns and make millions. Claes liked Oops Claes shared this Why This CEO Says ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to Venture Capital Claes liked I had an interesting chat with an old friend last week. The topic was money. I was being challenged on my right to earn what I earn... Forget the fact that I provide jobs and opportunity, I couldn't be fussed getting into it, so casually and jokingly replied, "Hey, I work hard." This aggravated the situation, and I was met with, "I work hard too." I have no doubt that he does, but there's a difference. Here's the deal folks. If you are willing to go through the risk, and drama, and heartache, and 18 hours days, and challenges, and obstacles, and pitfalls, and staff issues, and legal issues, and everything else that comes with running a business, then you DESERVE to earn a fortune. Unfortunately most folk don't get it, until they're in the situation. But to my fellow entrepreneurs, I salute you. And to those who want the financial freedom and wealth that comes with it, come on in, the waters lovely ;) Claes liked I think I am doing it wrong.

Yikang Luo Trade Support Engineer at the Divisa Capital March 30, 2016, Yikang and Miao were students together If somebody is smarter than me, I may be sort of frustrated; but if somebody is smarter and meanwhile, works harder than me, I would definitely show my respect. Miao is exactly the "somebody" who is smart and works hard. Based on the strong quant background from both Peking University and Beijing University of Technology, Miao did a perfect job on the backtesting session of our practicum project ETF enhancement with Social Market Analytics, Inc. Her knowledge of python and excel really impressed me. On top of that, her working efficiency should be emphasized as well, since she could always get the backtesting results in a very short time.Miao is also a very humble and easygoing lady. During our project, I learnt a lot of skills including python and excel from Miao. She always answers my question patiently. Those fantastic ideas of algorithms from Miao inspired me a lot as well.

He also takes care to make sure he understands the business requirements, and delivers something that will satisfy them, even when the users have difficulty articulating how it should work.Even with this extra care, his work products are delivered in the same or less time than I have grown accustomed to expecting from most developers, making him worth several more ordinary programmers.

Another ex-colleague noted that I was trying to hire engineers for the team and pinged to send in some leads to help. We may strive for all forms and definitions of success but the biggest assets of our lives are the friends we make along the way. They are out there rooting for us through thick and thin. And have a bigger impact on our life that we can imagine. So pause, take a break, and reach out to someone you care for. Send them a note, appreciate them, offer to help, or just say hi. Note their struggles, observe their journey, perhaps just be an audience to their life story. Who knows whose life you can brighten up today?

After eighteen months, I successfully made the transition from night clerk to day proprietary trader. In that role I was promoted to proprietary trader within two years. After the buyout of Chopper by DRW Holdings, LLC in January, 2015 I was among the group of treasury traders who were invited to join DRW. TradeIn my seven years of trading, I have focused on trading the US Treasury Yield Curve. I used the electronic cash exchanges on the BrokerTec and Espeed platforms and the futures exchanges on the CME Globex platform. My strategies have involved mostly spread and butterfly trading in the on-the-run cash products and the CME futures products. While I consistently traded all the CME and on-the-run products from the ZT to the 30 Yr cash, I focused most of my trading efforts on the ZN through the 30 Yr sector. StrategyI have employed a variety of strategies to affect a holding period typically between 4 hours and a week. My strategy would focus on product, curve and butterfly disruptions due to non-market aberrations of the yield curve. In practice this involved building spreads, butterflies or basis positions in order to target an area on the yield curve, single product or product group. Additionally, I would make various auction cycle plays, and time month/time of day trades, repo trades and general scalp trades.

During many group discussions regarding financial mathematics, he could explain many quantitative models with intuitive insight and facilitated a lot of joint work to different problems. To these days, we are still exchanging ideas and insights about financial market and modelling. After so many years on the trading world, I still consider him to be one of the best guy you want to have in your trading room! Charles Qin VP, (Global) Head of Quant. Analytics & Investment Risk at Aflac October 24, 2012, Leon worked with Charles in different groups It was a pleasure to work with Charles during my time in Milliman. Being a quantitative professional myself, I have met many other quantitative professionals but none was quite like Charles. Most quants are good at very specific things but they often neglect the big picture of quantitative/actuarial modelling. On the other hand, not only Charles has shown his insightful knowledge in many areas of modelling including but not limited to equity derivative, fixed income, insurance derivative, inflation product, mortgage, and credit, and he has also perfected the art of communicating quantitative ideas to other business unit, manage projects with IT, actuarial, and sales, and finally, facilitated many new opportunities with potential client.

Luke was the co-starter and instrumental player in the launch of the algorithmic trading desk at Saxon and I have no doubt today he can replicate that same achievement, but with much greater results that any trading desk would surely welcome and benefit from.

It was a three month internship, but in only a few weeks David had taken on responsibilities and a role well beyond my expectation. David has a strong leadership ability through the "lead by example" mentality. Additionally, this work product rivaled that of people who had been working in a similar role of Analyst for many years. David was engaged, thought provoking, hard working, and extremely thorough. I would (and will) look to hire him in the future if the opportunity presents itself. Eric Schuldt Systems Analyst at CME Group May 1, 2012, Eric managed David directly David is the epitome of what we will base our intern program going forward, the work he accomplished during his internship at the CME Group has been unmatched. His skill set has the perfect balance of analytical thinking, business comprehension, and technical proficiency. These attributes employed him to rapidly take his contributions to the next level. He consistently illustrated his ability to take abstract ideas and apply them practically both independently and in collaboration with others. David earned respect from everyone in our department by delivering more and more advanced work, all while making it look easy. Recently, he has stepped up as a leader on the project he‚Äôs working on, formulating and executing his own ideas, taking full ownership. I am excited to see what he‚Äôll conquer next.
