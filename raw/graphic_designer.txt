Music, books, design and tea make up a large portion of my life and I wouldn't have it any other way. Although I specialize in several fields of design, editorial work is my passion. Through my schooling I have obtained knowledge and experience with advertising, brand identity, web design and several other crucial areas of design. I'm a recent graduate looking to make my mark in the graphic design world.

Something has to change. Candidates can't commit months of time when they are either currently employed or just lost their job. In either position it leaves them vulnerable. Things move fast and so do good candidates. Sierra liked I HAVE HAD ENOUGH of creative agencies recruiting interns and graduates and making them work for free. This is extremely bad for our industry and I am appalled and disgusted that this is happening over and over again. Instead of starting Black List of the organisations to watch out for (which is just a bit shitty), I am starting a Green List (Green means GO!) to promote the creative agencies who value their juniors, and not only pay* them, but support our future generation of creatives. Got an example? Please write them in the comments, and I will add them to the list. *Worth pointing out that paying does not necessarily equal money. There can be other forms of collaboration. The point is to shut down the people who think it's OK to offer nothing. Right? EDIT: Wow. I am overwhelmed with the fantastic responses! Over 9000+ likes, 500+ comments and nearly 1 million views. WOW. I am looking into ways of creating this list properly, speaking with various partners.

These larger projects can span several months and often involve working with the other disciplines within the company such as interiors to create the internal graphical pieces they need or briefing the production team for them to send finished items out to print.Smaller more independent clients may require a brand refresh starting with conceptual and innovative ideas, through to creating a fresh brand identity which then needs a set of brand guidelines creating. I will often take ownership of these projects on behalf of either managing directors for both the Birmingham or Dubai offices and see them through from start to finished artwork.My work environment is open plan and fast paced so it’s important that I am able to prioritise both my time and work load to ensure that I not only manage several projects but clearly communicate to the relevant people what is required or the thinking behind the design.

In 2012, I also got a chance to work as a graphic design intern at BlackBerry (Waterloo, ON) for 1 year. I'm currently building an online business specifically for wedding invitations and stationery.As a graphic designer,- I constantly learn new things everyday and one of the things I do as soon as I get to work is visit up to five websites full of design inspiration. I’m constantly looking at what is getting noticed and talked about in the design world so that I can apply the same professionalism to my work. I also keep an eye on what the current design trends are and where they are going. When I start a project, I can go back to it and find inspiring design work that I’ve saved to help kick start my creative process. - I take criticism as a means of improving myself. As a designer, I learn that when my work is under criticism, there's no need to take it personally. My motto is to be receptive and open-minded towards criticism. I hear all criticism with an open mind and is willing to change designs based on the needs or wants of a client or opinions of members of the design team.- Managing priorities (multitasking) is a piece of cake. I learn how to work fast when I worked at BlackBerry where every task required a quick turnaround. For me, a great graphic designer should be able to work within boundaries of deadlines and changing priorities and can effectively manage a workload to meet deadlines and satisfy clients.- I work very well as part of a team and recognize that all team members must work well together and communicate openly to get a project completed.- I am well-versed in a plethora of desktop publishing software and is able to quickly learn new programs and incorporate them into my work.

If you email him, he will reply, usually with a phone call straight away; even if nothing is available or there is no feedback to give, he's still engaging and keeping you up to date with everything that is going on in any process you are in, are what is available to your skill set.Not only Is Lee one of the best recruitment contacts, I feel, in the industry, I have also made a great friend out of it!If you are looking to land your dream job and need help, Lee is your man and Amiqus are your people!

Over that time I've learned that change is the only constant and to embrace it is not only wise but rewarding. Design for me is about recreating, reinventing, refreshing in new and exciting ways. The ability to work globally expands the limit of possibility and allows people to come together in ways previously unheard of, forging new connections into different cultures and experiences. My own experience in design and advertising has been distilled over time into where I find myself today focused within the areas of identity and icon design and illustration. Early on I embraced a clean, simple approach to design and illustration. Clean line, ordered chaos but not lifeless. Great design should not only solve a communication challenge but also have a lasting quality to go the distance. How long it's relevance is relevant is a measure of it's success. Change is good. But change for change sake? Not so good. Reason, Need and Accountability, those are the raw materials for great design to be crafted from.I am looking to partner and forge relationships with others as a freelance creative professional, bringing my design and illustration experience to the table where an extra hand or team member is required. If my work strikes a chord with you and you feel I can contribute to your teams success, I'd encourage you to contact me. Thank you.Specialties: Identity, Icon, Illustration.

He is extraordinarily attentive to detail, extremely accurate, and quick, which allows him to meet very tight deadlines without compromising the quality of his work. He knows the ins and outs of inDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Quark, as well as of Macs.

Projection:Happiness touches the heart and enables the creativity to come from within. The one who is happy doesn't wait for the right opportunity to be creative, but uses each moment as a chance for using creativity - for bringing newness. Solution: When I am happy I am able to enjoy and make the best use of each and every moment of my life. I will want to do something new, unique and different. So I also have the satisfaction of having done my best. Siba Sahu liked Bow down before the one you serve, you're going to get what you deserve ~ Trent Reznor. Good morning.

More Actions Kevin has a account Kevin Cox Visual Designer at Amazon Amazon Seattle Central Creative Academy Seattle, Washington 324 324 connections Connect Pending Invitation Sent Hello! My name is Kevin Cox, and I'm a graphic designer in Seattle. I have eight years of experience, ranging from small start-ups to giant corporations. I thrive on user-centered logic, create efficient production workflows, and design to pixel-perfect detail. While instinctively self-motivated and ambitious, I feel that I really shine when part of a collaborative team. I love to hear others' perspectives, and bounce ideas back-and-forth—I believe that multiple perspectives are integral to bringing any project to its highest potential.www.kevincoxdesign.com See moreSee more of undefined summary Highlights Recommendations Received (5) Given (0) Laura Leigh Landolf Graphic Designer & Illustrator March 7, 2016, Laura Leigh worked with Kevin in different groups Kevin is one of the most talented, meticulously detailed, visual designers I have ever worked with! I don't make anything without asking Kevin for his thoughts, because he always knows when something needs improvement or if it is simply perfect as is. Speaking of perfection, I have blissfully watched Kevin design beautiful styleguides, direct photoshoots with precision, and school even the most educated Photoshop user on how they can better improve their skills. I know all of these things first-hand because of my time working with him at Amazon Creative Services. The design team relies heavily on him for his eye for detail, and they frequently ask him to come up with trending designs for both photoshoots and site-oriented marketing materials, On top of his design duties, I have seen Kevin take on writing Wikipedia entries for the internal Amazon Wikipedia. He is capable of communicating large-scale ideas and new improvements to the Amazon site on said Wiki, and is so admired for his work that he has now started to train others on how to better write internal Wikis. Kevin is also a wonderful person to work with, as he is always thinking of new, fun ways to improve the work culture around the office. If I were looking for the most talented, knowledgable, and thoughtful designer, I would choose Kevin in a heartbeat! Jean-Roux Bezuidenhout Digital Brand Architect and Problem Solver. June 25, 2012, Jean-Roux was senior to Kevin but didn’t manage directly I truly enjoyed working with Kevin at Blue Nile. He's a young, driven and inspired designer, with front end development chops to boot. I believe Kevin will flourish into an incredible creative given a mentoring and supportive environment. I especially admired his willingness to get stuck in and deliver. Add to that - Kevin's comprehension of next wave technology, and you get a modern, young, creative that makes things happen.

Loyola College in Maryland Greater New York City Area 166 166 connections Connect Pending Invitation Sent Hello! I am a graphic designer with a curiosity for all industries. With 6 years of tackling design through internships, freelance and full time roles, I've developed a strong appreciation for the diverse "voices" and unique styles of other designers. I'm a firm believer that everyone has potential to be creative and honed in their skills as a design, but very little opportunity to reveal it. I've mentored fellow students as an undergraduate in college, and look forward to connecting with more seasoned designers. As a designer, my goal is to show employers, clients and audiences alike that I am listening to their point of views. Although, being a graphic designer, I have my own tastes in style, focusing on identity of companies and their clients remain important to me in any project. Before I start any project I want to know your vision.

September 18, 2013, Robin worked with Christina in the same group I had the pleasure of working with Robin Jones while we both worked in DoD CIO. As the Administrative Assistant to the DoD CIO I reported directly to Ms. Takai (the DoD CIO) and was often involved in a myraid of projects that needed a "talented touch" that Robin provided again and again with her creative approach. She has the ability to turn drab, plain text into an interesting, eye-catching, visually intriguing piece of information. I truly hope to one day be able to work with her again in the future. Kim Danek Writer/Editor at U.S. Department of Health and Human Services October 10, 2013, Kim managed Robin directly Robin Jones is an imaginative, talented, experienced graphic artist. While she was at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, she developed numerous briefing slide decks, posters, booklets, and other print and electronic products. All were highly effective, well-developed products that the client loved and valued. Her sense of style and less-is-more design allowed her products to communicate exactly what they should without being mucked up by extraneous elements. Ms. Jones also taught me (a non-graphic artist) about graphic design so that I could do updates in her absence. This allowed us to ensure that products could be edited if necessary so the mission would not be impacted greatly when she was on vacation. I have taken what she has taught me to my future assignments and have been able to produce much better products based on the design lessons she taught me. She is an incredible graphic artist and I would love to work with her again in the future.

No challenge is ever too big or complex for her, she's able to tackle any problem head on and come out with a solid, clear plan of action as well as a brilliant design. We worked closely on the Verizon Smart Rewards program together and I had the chance to see her lead the team to success countless times. She's also a wonderful and patient teacher, I could always go to Rachel for any questions I had and she was always willing to help. Her work is consistently inspiring, smart, and innovative, and I can't recommend her enough. I hope our career paths will cross again in the future! Jon Friesch Marketing and Customer Experience Strategist March 24, 2016, Jon managed Rachel directly Rachel is, to me, the best kind of graphic designer: creative and strategic. Rachel produces rich marketing materials that are designed to accomplish a goal, but she can also lay out a holistic strategy, beyond the piece she's working on, that helps her, and the people working around her, understand where each piece fits into the greater plan.Rachel is hungry and ambitious and always trying to learn and do the next thing. She fit in well with my department and was a key part of the Verizon Smart Rewards loyalty program - originating many of the design approaches they use today. If you're seeking a sharp designer who can design AND think and has barely scratched the surface of her potential, I would recommend hiring Rachel.

I had the privilege of working with her as she grew from a young designer to someone whose process and designs rivaled our more experienced team members. The work she did for Verizon required her to give strategic recommendations and plan user experiences in addition to visual design. Her commitment to delivering high quality content and visuals is what led to many satisfied clients as well as a W3 gold award.Whether it's testing a new method on a project or taking SVC classes to learn new programs, Yeji is continually expanding her skill set. She is an extremely fast learner and her ability to tackle complicated challenges in a methodical and visual way is one of her greatest assets.

September 15, 2015, Alissa was Allie’s teacher Allie is one of those rare digital unicorns: she merges keen design thinking with project strategy and has the ability to implement front-end code herself. She's a startup triple threat. I had the honor of teaching her the tools and processes of User-Centered Design during her time at the Startup Institute, but she didn't need much teaching. She is an excellent collaborator and has the unique ability to keep one eye on the big picture and one on the details. Finally, she has a no-BS approach, a fantastic sense of humor, and always seeks to do meaningful work that has a positive impact on the world. Those are my favorite types of people to work with. I look forward to working with her in the future. Nitya Jain Visual Designer, Creative Strategist September 8, 2015, Allie worked with Nitya in the same group Allie is an extremely creative and meticulous designer. Her graphic design background sets her apart in the way she brings elegance and detail to every piece of work be it print or digital.In the 8 weeks at Startup Institute, Allie mastered HTML, CSS and showed it in her portfolio and partner project.She organized workshops in her time there to help fellow students creat elegant websites and resumes. Allie is the most creative and optimistic person I have met and would be invaluable to any company she is a part of. View 1 more recommendation View 1 more recommendation recommendations Nitya Jain Visual Designer, Creative Strategist August 27, 2015, Allie and Nitya were students together Nitya is a driven and detail-oriented designer coming from a successful background in architecture. She easily translated the foundations of design into her digital work by creating low and high fidelity prototypes. In her 8-week stint at Startup Institute she gained the technical skills of HTML, CSS and Javascript to build out her own successful portfolio site. If she can achieve that much in 8 weeks, imagine what she can achieve for your company.

He joined my group on a temporary basis when large volumes of projects were in process and many more were being initiated. There was little time for introduction to the deep and wide file structure and other common administrative support items. He delivered work on a quick turn time and operated with little oversight.Kenny also showed interest in and was comfortable taking on assignments beyond the original scope of work. Performing Photoshop touch-up work on multiple photos for large-scale product compositions is one example.Kenny followed complicated instructions well with no trouble and tracked a large number of assignments. He provided multiple creative layout options when appropriate despite limited photography choices and corporate design expectations.

I started painting back in the early 1970's and—although I've done a LOT of different things in the meantime—painting has always been my first love.As a means of getting back to painting full time, I've recently decided to try out the "Daily Painting" model... Painting small canvases, every day as a part of my discipline. Not to exclude larger, more "ambitious" work, but the discipline of doing a new small painting every day is liberating, and I expect to see my work loosen up and feel freer as a result.I'm also going to be selling these new small paintings at auction on DailyPaintWorks.com and try to make use of some of the social media (like https://www.facebook.com/GoodeGallery) to gain more exposure.I also design and build websites for small businesses and entrepreneurs—building with either the WordPress or Drupal Content Management Systems—depending on the specific needs for the site. I also provide a range of graphic design services, including newsletters, brochures, mailers, and other print collateral.I am a highly experienced Graphic Designer with over 20 years in the field. I have been in magazine publishing as both a designer and art director; I've worked in marketing and advertising; and I have a great deal of experience in both team and project management. Over the years, as an employee in different organizations, and as a freelancer, I have developed and honed a broad range of skills. Specialties: Web design/development with Drupal, XHTML, CSS, WordPress, and other web design applications. Expertise in Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign.

But I've decided that this is what I really want to do, so I'm back in the studio and experimenting with the Daily Painting Movement.My work is mostly realistic, leaning to impressionistic.

I started painting back in the early 1970's and—although I've done a LOT of different things in the meantime—painting has always been my first love.As a means of getting back to painting full time, I've recently decided to try out the "Daily Painting" model... Painting small canvases, every day as a part of my discipline. Not to exclude larger, more "ambitious" work, but the discipline of doing a new small painting every day is liberating, and I expect to see my work loosen up and feel freer as a result.I'm also going to be selling these new small paintings at auction on DailyPaintWorks.com and try to make use of some of the social media (like https://www.facebook.com/GoodeGallery) to gain more exposure.I also design and build websites for small businesses and entrepreneurs—building with either the WordPress or Drupal Content Management Systems—depending on the specific needs for the site. I also provide a range of graphic design services, including newsletters, brochures, mailers, and other print collateral.I am a highly experienced Graphic Designer with over 20 years in the field. I have been in magazine publishing as both a designer and art director; I've worked in marketing and advertising; and I have a great deal of experience in both team and project management. Over the years, as an employee in different organizations, and as a freelancer, I have developed and honed a broad range of skills.

I've used her to help me with designing multiple ads and a gift certificate, and have been thoroughly pleased with the results each time.Not being a designer myself, I can't really discuss it intelligently, but I can tell the difference between good work, and not so good...and Erika has nailed it every time I needed something. I provided a graphic she'd made for me once to a company who I tried some advertising with, and they said they could alter it as necessary very easily. The proof came back to me with all this white space at the bottom, and just didn't look the same. I just sent it to her, said "This is what I need", and it came back just like I'd hoped...brilliantly.I intend to use Erika for all my design work in the future, and have no problem recommending her to others I know that need work done.

Erika happily took up the challenge - with smiles - and produced some amazing design concepts that I expect will yield measurable results in my business.

I thought there was no hope, but fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised with the results that Quest Floor Care was able to provide. The smell was completely gone and there was minimal discoloration (which I'm told can be dramatic after cleaning rugs with pet damage). Joseph was extremely thorough, making calls throughout the process to make sure there were no issues along the way. I would absolutely hire Quest Floor Care again, and I highly recommend them for any floor care need. April Amodeo Photographer & Artist | Amodeo Photography | Rebel Fish ART June 6, 2012, Erika was a client of April’s April is an incredibly talented and creative photographer. The first time I worked with April, she took professional head shots for myself and two of my colleagues. We were looking for something different. We didn't want the usual staged studio shots, but were looking for something that would really express our personalities. April did an amazing job and we were thrilled with the results. She was so fun to work with and had a way of making you comfortable in front of the camera to get your personality to shine through. Since then I have recommended April to many of my friends as well as clients in need of professional or corporate photography. I highly recommend April and look forward to more opportunities to work with her in the future.

More Actions Lauren has a account Lauren Cohen Los Angeles based Graphic Designer and Magician Farmers Insurance Western Washington University Greater Los Angeles Area 500+ 500+ connections Connect Pending Invitation Sent My first approach to every project is asking myself, "What can I do that hasn't already been done?" The second step is asking myself, "How can I come up with a solution that is fun and productive, yet unique?" When the flight attendant announced on the loudspeaker that the first person who spotted a whale, would receive a prize, I was the four year old on the plane who drew a whale on a vomit bag and won the prize. A task is not always about completing it the same way as it was done before, but rather, it can be about creating new and innovative approaches to receive a more positive response. I enjoy wearing different hats at once and being a graphic designer, producer, copywriter, and magician allows for so much fun. The hats have no limits, and therefore, I thirst for knowledge and anything I do not already know, I am willing and eager to learn. Having a career as a magician especially helps my design career. I am forced to not only think outside of the box, but I am taught to create boxes that may or may not previously exist. I love creating a variety of solutions to every problem and having excellent time-management skills allows me to think creatively and bring a breath of fresh air to any problem in the same amount of time given.I pride myself on giving my 100% best effort towards any task delivered to me despite there being a possibility of a learning curve, and I excitedly and readily welcome in new challenges.

Beyond work, she makes time for a number of extra-curricular activities that enrich her life and make her a better designer and human being. Also, she's a magician!

My role as Guardian was to transport a local World War II hero from the Tampa Bay area on an all expense paid flight to visit the memorials in Washington, D.C. Top priority is given to the senior veterans – World War II survivors, along with those other veterans who may be terminally ill. My greatest thrill was witnessing first-hand the hundreds and thousands of people that received the veterans at the airport in Baltimore. Many were active duty themselves, stationed out of Fort Meade and the United States Naval Academy. It was pretty emotional, yet inspiring at the same time to see these heroes finally honored for their service and sacrifice that changed the world almost 70 years ago.

Patrick Daniel "Pat" Tillman was an NFL (National Football League) safety with the Arizona Cardinals organization who put his career on hold to serve our country in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. On the evening of April 22, 2004, while maneuvering with his unit through the canyons of eastern Afghanistan, Pat was tragically killed in action while in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.While the story of Pat’s death may have been the most publicized in the War on Terror, it is Pat’s life, principles and service that are his true legacy. Pat’s family and friends started the Pat Tillman Foundation to carry forward that legacy by giving military veterans and spouses who embody those principles the educational tools and support to reach their fullest potential as leaders, no matter how they choose to serve. Every year, 60 new visionary Tillman Military Scholars are added to the community who build on Pat's legacy, principles and commitment to service. To fulfill my desire to contribute to this worthy cause, I have pledged to raise donations that will directly benefit selected Tillman Military Scholars, as well as volunteering for the 2015 TCS New York City Marathon campaign. Fortunately, my application was approved, and as a result I will be running my first Marathon in support of the Pat Tillman Foundation on Sunday, November 1st, 2015 as a member of Team Tillman.

Also, I was the store's primary trainer for new cashiers/customer service associates.

In June 2013, I was selected and flown to Minot, North Dakota by the company to train up associates at a new Gordmans store that was being built. Along with another Gordmans associate-trainer, I taught around seventy to eighty new associates how to cashier and maintain excellent customer service skills.

I'll rather talk about his super fast time of response (once we were in a hurry and in a matter of 2 days Nenad had a logo ready for a communication campaign, and the client was delighted!!!); I'll rather talk about his ability to interpret your requirements as a client and turn them into awsome and daring design proposals. I'll rather talk about his candid feedback from a designer's point of view, when a client suggests things that won't work as a good design in the end (not all of us have a fine designer's taste, eventhough we think we do lol).Last but not least, I have to say that Nenad is a man of his word (sorry to say that's something very difficult to find in a graphic designer, no mather how talented that designer might be); I've worked with him in 4 different projects now, and he has NEVER failed to deliver on time.Warning: If you're expecting an ordinary (boring) design, look somewhere else. hasn’t given any recommendations yet.

The interview started as usual and we had some interesting discussions. During our discussion we also talked about how 'Certification' is different from 'Skill'. You may know a lot of things but that knowledge is of use only when it turns into your skill. Some key points from the discussion : • Most testers are after buzz words like Automation, Frameworks, Performance, Scripting etc. and they would do some courses, get certifications to be a 'certified tester' instead of being a 'Skilled tester' • You might be 'Certified', you may be having a Master's degree but these would only be good once you have skill to use the knowledge you gained through these. • If you want to remain in demand in this ever changing market, 'Be Skilled' and not just 'certified'. • 'Certifications' are given by external bodies who tell 'you' that you are good at something' 'Your Skill' will tell others that you're good at something, and this will 'not' require external bodies certifying this for you.

As a graphic web designer I help entrepreneurs to achieve profitable and sustainable growth through these ways of communication. The reason I became a graphic designer is to pursue my love of colors and symbols and the effect it has on visual communication. Through graphic design I can mix all these elements to create something meaningful in conveying powerful messages. The mistake many entrepreneurs and business owners have is that they don't understand that their business gives a message through the fonts, symbols, colors and their logos need to be original, not a clip art. I understand that as a small business or new business expenses can be high but a right logo or corporate image can open imaginable doors and that is something I see there is still a misconception on what real design is.I became an author because I am passionate about life, with life's twists and turns and all that is needed to share my experiences and what I have learned.My other passion is art and in my leisure time I like to paint, you can see my art in: http://graysart.wordpress.comSpanish, art and graphic design teacherI am eager to bring students a unique combination of education experience in Spanish and or Art trough using developmentally-appropriate environment that incorporates a variety of developmentally appropriate activities, lesson plans and skills that need to be learned.Social Media Marketing:I got into Social Media to develop communication to people using other innovative and powerful channels.Through the combination of these skills and experience I offer the services that convey powerful, colorful and well oriented messages that communicate in the way people and culture want to be communicated.

Overall, Marty seeks to understand and get down to the 'why' of a project before starting work. He has tremendous business sense and skills well beyond that of a marketing professional. His ability to see the forest rather than the trees is of great assistance to any business. He is more of a business consultant first, then marketing guru, sensei. It is incredibly hard to explain his overall abilities which are truly unique and comprehensive. Marty is New York talent with CEO style vision wrapped in a caring heart for his clients. It is a pleasure to see his work in action. To this day, everyone that receives one of the palettes he designed for us just falls in love with it and doesn't want to let it go.

Constantly focused and hard working! I have never met a Web Designer/Individual in such early stages of her career as adapt and in-tune as Lauren. Her demeanor and dedication to not only perfect her craft but to the agency and its clients is highly unmatched. She tackles every project with an enthusiasm and a passion that is contagious. Lauren is always willing to team up, learn or push the envelope for the agency and clients. She is like a sponge, she gets it. Yet, if she is unsure of an execution or application then she teaches herself! Not only to just get the job done but done to the highest of her ability and client standards. I know very few web people with her dedication, zest for success and comprehensive knowledge of the web and/or mobile creative execution.As a person, Lauren is strong willed, personable, intellectual and compassionate.

His natural talent to write along with his dedication and passion for great creative thrives in each and every project or client that Tim works on.Tim's most outstanding trait is his "infectious and positive can do" attitude, combined with his outstanding client knowledge, and complete commitment to them and the entire agency. Never in late and always staying after hours Tim is the perfect employee to add to any team that wants commitment, dedication, and expertise.As an individual, Tim would go to the ends of the earth to help out his team members and friends. He values those relationships and treats everyone he comes in contact with absolute respect. Tim is true to his word and will absolutely exceed any and all expectations.

America has thoroughly rejected them in every branch of the federal government plus out in the states, and on top of that they were utterly humiliated by the guy they all claimed was a complete moron. Which begs the question – what does that make the sanctimonious harpy he crushed in the Electoral College? They still haven’t realized what’s going on. Their ego-driven drive to dominate normal people and shape us into New Socialist Nongendered Beings has blinded them to the bitter reality. The Democrats are being crazy and it’s a bad look. So let’s keep helping them do it. We can pity them even as we laugh at them. Laura liked a comment So I spent my Friday night after the fabulous AITD 2017 conference being a total learning nerd.

Perhaps one of the most familiar graphic symbols and most derided because of it. In the 80s in particular one might have been forgiven for thinking that their inclusion in any piece of design work was enshrined in law. They are loved and hated in equal measure. Now there's no escape from them because we have emojis and their meaning has evolved. These flagstones are part of an information regime which was put in place in anticipation of the opening of Tate Modern an incredible 17 years ago and to direct visitors to other places of interest in historic Southwark, such as John Harvard's house and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.

Her rates are good and the value is over the top.

They expect that brand to be reflected accurately in their new marketing materials. That's when they call me. I'm the guy who reads the manual — otherwise known as the brand identity guidelines. When implementing a brand, the strategy (e.g., mission and vision; messaging and positioning) is just as valuable as the visual identity (e.g., logo usage, typography, and color palette). A client once referred to me as the thinking person's designer. They said one of my greatest strengths is the ability to understand — both analytically and intuitively — a new or existing brand strategy. This ability allows me to generate graphic solutions that get results.

It bothered me and I found myself trying to justify why I'm almost 40 and not in a Management or Director level role in IT after 13 years. This is why. I love what I do. Do I like resetting passwords for the same folks every day? No. But I do love the sound of relief after I have. I'm grateful I'm the first person people reach out to when they don't know what to do. I like knowing people feel they can count on me to get the job done right the first time. I'm blessed enough to be trusted by my company with access to just about any application we have, and I'm thankful my team respects me enough to hang on for the ride.

She takes an idea, builds the strategy behind it and can lead an effort bringing others on-board even when they are not in her chain of command. She has a way of creating and communicating a plan that makes others want to follow. She does an amazing job at seeing the big picture and and tying everything together for a polished finish. I highly recommend Stephanie! She is a super performer! Petra Neiger Marketing Executive, Digital, Social, Content, Communications, Organizational Health Advocate May 27, 2011, Stephanie worked with Petra in the same group I've been working with Stephanie for several years and we've been on the same team for about a year now. I simply love working with her. She is a strategic thinker with great analytical and project management skills. She has the ability to come up with an idea and then turn in into reality. She looks at each situation from multiple angles, gathers information from people - which she augments with her own thinking, synthesizes her findings and offers a solution that is most appropriate for the given situation. She stays calm and focused even when many things are coming at her once and she never misses sight of the big picture. Her recommendations are sound and she articulates them clearly and concisely. Her efforts around measurement and listening have been recognized internally as well as externally. On top of that, she is a very nice person who is dedicated to her team.

Ryan is a strong, visionary, and strategic leader who brought an innovative and disciplined approach to building the social media team from 2-3 people to a world-class team of 15+. He excels at hiring diverse talent and building high-performing teams. Ryan always made his team felt heard and recognized, and personally Ryan gave me many opportunities to learn and develop my career. One of the things I appreciate most about Ryan is his ability to bring out the best in his team—he does this by asking thought-provoking questions that encourage new and fresh thinking that pushes the work even further. I enjoyed working with Ryan and hope we get the opportunity to work together again! Amy Gipsman Social Media Community Manager at Starbucks January 30, 2017, Stephanie was senior to Amy but didn’t manage directly Amy is a smart, talented and high-performing individual. She’s a team player, well liked by all those she interacts with, and also works well independently. What impresses me most about Amy is that she is detailed and executes perfectly but she’s also a strategic thinker and has vast potential to do so much more. Amy is a pleasure to work with – she is thoughtful and articulate, reliable, takes ownership for her work, and continually strives for excellence. Given the opportunity, I would hire her in a heartbeat and hope we get to work together again!

She takes an idea, builds the strategy behind it and can lead an effort bringing others on-board even when they are not in her chain of command. She has a way of creating and communicating a plan that makes others want to follow. She does an amazing job at seeing the big picture and and tying everything together for a polished finish. I highly recommend Stephanie! She is a super performer! Petra Neiger Marketing Executive, Digital, Social, Content, Communications, Organizational Health Advocate May 27, 2011, Stephanie worked with Petra in the same group I've been working with Stephanie for several years and we've been on the same team for about a year now. I simply love working with her. She is a strategic thinker with great analytical and project management skills. She has the ability to come up with an idea and then turn in into reality. She looks at each situation from multiple angles, gathers information from people - which she augments with her own thinking, synthesizes her findings and offers a solution that is most appropriate for the given situation. She stays calm and focused even when many things are coming at her once and she never misses sight of the big picture. Her recommendations are sound and she articulates them clearly and concisely. Her efforts around measurement and listening have been recognized internally as well as externally. On top of that, she is a very nice person who is dedicated to her team.

Ryan is a strong, visionary, and strategic leader who brought an innovative and disciplined approach to building the social media team from 2-3 people to a world-class team of 15+. He excels at hiring diverse talent and building high-performing teams. Ryan always made his team felt heard and recognized, and personally Ryan gave me many opportunities to learn and develop my career. One of the things I appreciate most about Ryan is his ability to bring out the best in his team—he does this by asking thought-provoking questions that encourage new and fresh thinking that pushes the work even further. I enjoyed working with Ryan and hope we get the opportunity to work together again! Amy Gipsman Social Media Community Manager at Starbucks January 30, 2017, Stephanie was senior to Amy but didn’t manage directly Amy is a smart, talented and high-performing individual. She’s a team player, well liked by all those she interacts with, and also works well independently. What impresses me most about Amy is that she is detailed and executes perfectly but she’s also a strategic thinker and has vast potential to do so much more. Amy is a pleasure to work with – she is thoughtful and articulate, reliable, takes ownership for her work, and continually strives for excellence. Given the opportunity, I would hire her in a heartbeat and hope we get to work together again!

With Sonoma Raceway a short drive from Benicia, one of NASCAR's biggest stars from Vallejo, a Legends World Champion living in town, and a future champion in the form of the granddaughter of one of the city's colorful artists, there was plenty to write about. Because the Benicia Herald is a small publication, with a very small editorial department, we would wear many hats. Mine included writer, designer, photographer, and occasional illustrator. "Assistant Editor"​ also meant making sure the paper was put together and out the door when the Editor is away. Having to do this challenged me to not shy away from making 'executive decisions' on the paper, then living with those decisions.

Banding/migration studies Company Name Golden Gate Raptor Observatory Dates volunteered Aug 1997 – Dec 1998 Volunteer duration 1 yr 5 mos Cause Animal Welfare The Golden Gate Raptor Observatory is a program of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy in cooperation with the National Park Service. From the GGRO's website, their mission statement is: "The GGRO’s mission is to inspire the preservation of California raptor populations. The GGRO was formed in the early 1980s to track the Golden Gate migration, an annual flight of tens of thousands of hawks, eagles, falcons, and vultures, birds collectively called 'raptors.'"I was a part of the "banding" team, which would trap raptors, band them, and record their statistics before releasing them. This process involved a lot of training for the safety of the birds and the people who would handle them.

Not only was he always courteous to clients, but worked hard to give clients the most efficient form of what they asked for - meeting their requirements, but going the extra mile to really get them excited about their forthcoming affiliation with AOA. Additionally, Chris went out of his way to help members of his own team - brainstorming efficiency methods, flowcharting, and helping to map challenging processes. His unique insight was immensely valued even during the premature planning stages of projects and he provided a perspective that significantly improved the plan itself. Chris managed his team well, counseling his team through what can be a challenging move from Traditional Waterfall methods to Agile methods, with the added stressor of production on a tight timeline. Here he excelled, making sure to check in with his team frequently, help them when they had questions about the Agile process, and provide assistance when unexpected roadblocks were encountered. He made sure to support his staff in all ways possible.Overall, it was a delight to work with Chris. No matter the situation, he was ready to take on the day with a smile, a joke, or a pep talk - reminding his staff, or those in other branches of the team, that they were all working hard, producing well, and learning from their experiences. Kristen Harrison Residential/Community Educator at The Principia February 23, 2009, Kristen worked with Chris but at different companies Chris is a genuinely unique talent, combining the gift of being able to think in creative and different ways with the ability to implement those ideas in a real-world, usable format. His graphic design work runs the gamut from classic professional to cutting edge and eye-catching. Whether you need a simple website to direct your customers to you, or something more outrageous and attention-getting, I highly recommend Chris Stringer. There are lots of web/graphic designers out there. Chris is something special and original.

And she takes the time to talk the client through the design process and advise them on all aspects of the job, including the imagery that would be most suitable. She is very good at communicating and keeps the client informed all the way. In short, once you’ve had the pleasure of working with Angie, you’ll want to use of exclusively on project after project. Joe Sczempka Experienced Executive in Special Events & Conference Management October 6, 2008, Angie was a client of Joe’s I worked with Joe for several years when he was the President at SDEA and cannot say enough GREAT things about him! He hired me to do the graphic design for all the class schedules, direct mail marketing and design projects. Through his excellent leadership and unwavering support we were able to create some of the most effective (and fun) marketing materials I have ever done.Joe was personable, always accessible and professionally supportive no matter what the occasion. He is, without a doubt, one of the top executives I have had the pleasure of working for in the 18 years I've owned my business.If you haven't had the pleasure of meeting Joe, you are truly missing out. He's one of a kind ... and will stand as one of my favorite employers and friends!Angie RobertsGraphic Details John Silverman Owner, SoCalPRINT August 3, 2008, Angie was a client of John’s As a graphic designer, I spent 3 very frustrating years and went through SEVERAL printers looking for one that would do what he said he would do, at the time he said he would do it and then stand behind what he did! Finally, I found John Silverman, who at the time worked for ColorWorks, and I have followed him to Ideal Servcies and now to his own company. He handles ALL my printing projects and has for the last 15+ years.I have recommended him to several people and rave about his honesty, integrity and the quality of work he puts out. I know if I give John a job it will be done on time, at the price he has quoted me without any frustrating surprises. Plus he takes the time to double check my work before going to press saving me lots of time and money.I wouldn't think of going anywhere else but SoCal Print .... my clients except the BEST and John delivers every time!Angie RobertsGraphic Details Accomplishments Angie has 4 projects 4 Expand projects section Projects Kapfer Glass Studio located in Saint Petersburg, Florida JB Safety Services, Inc.

He has stood out in class as being one with an enthusiastic attitude who continually seeks to improve his design skills and inspire others.

View 1 more recommendation View 1 more recommendation recommendations Therese Arkenberg The Manuscript Doctor: Prescriptions for Strong Storytelling ✒ Developmental & Copy-Editing April 22, 2017, Jeremy was a client of Therese’s I have had the luxury of working with Therese on three manuscripts. Two of my manuscripts she was assigned to me by my publisher. Therese's ability to navigate my science fiction novel was amazing. She not only did line edits that were far superior to her contemporaries, she managed to inject useful and thoughtful comments to help improve the story along the way. Because of her outstanding work, I sought her out for an independent novel I wrote. Again, her work was amazing. My manuscript came back dosed in a familiar red, and I knew it would be better for it. Her suggestions made it obvious she spent time looking up facts and helping me flesh out some shaky areas of my story. Each edit was money well spent and I would highly recommend her for anybody looking for a thorough, efficient, and in-depth editor. Jordan Cline Intern at the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School June 24, 2014, Jeremy was Jordan’s teacher In a school of two thousand students, it is hard to be heard above the many voices housed within. Jordan Cline has never had this issue. As a class officer, I was excited to have Jordan in my class. Rarely is it the teacher who is excited by the individual students in their class, but upon seeing his name on my roster I knew we could think bigger and I could raise my expectations. Jordan not only provided work appropriate to the class, he used his position as a class leader to help further social causes such as Erase the Hate. Because of this the reach of this anti-bullying campaign found new heights. Because of his handwork, dedication, and extremely open personality, I believe Jordan has a bright future. His positive outlook on life and willingness to be in the trenches will make him a unique and amazing addition to any workplace environment.

He is that wonderful combination of big talent and being a good person that will take him a long way in the world. Abigail Weinberg Junior Compositor at The Molecule August 5, 2016, David managed Abigail directly You know how every once in a while you run into someone who has it all: charming, easy to get along with, and a gem of a human being? That person is Abby Weinberg. I am a teacher at school of Visual Arts, and I had the pleasure of having Abby in my digital matte painting class. During the semester, Abby stood out as a singularly talented student. She consistently demanded the best from herself, even if it meant reworking a project and searching for something uniquely "hers". After the semester ended, I stayed in touch with Abby, and saw her grow and become more confident as an artist, and as a person. Now that she has graduated, I have watched as she embarked on her career in visual effects compositing. I suspect we will all see remarkable work from Abby in the future.

I'd worked with another designer for more than a decade and was nervous about finding a new go-to designer, that mix of technical expertise, creative talent and working ease. The relationship with Jeanne has been terrific: she's a great designer, she listens (a hard quality to find with many creative partners) and she's very client focused. Her work comes in on time/on budget/on strategy - a hat trick of good qualities. She's able to take my creative briefs and brand standards and create beautiful work. I recommend Jeanne to both small and large businesses in need of design and creative direction. Christina Dalessio Marketing Manager at BerryDunn March 30, 2008, Christina worked with Jeanne but at different companies Jeanne is a seasoned marketing communications expert and a talented designer. She brings deep insight, creative ideas and genuine enthusiasm to every project. She collaborates well, communicates clearly and incorporates input and feedback graciously. I trust her instincts and admire her creative abilities. She is also a strategic brander who thinks systematically and always maintains a vision of the big picture while perfecting the finer details. Most important, she is a pleasure to work with: fun, funny, smart, dedicated, energetic and positive. Diana Laird Experienced Graphic Designer/Art Director July 26, 2012, Jeanne worked with Diana but at different companies Diana is a superior designer, with excellent visual typographic and image creation design skills.

Kevin Brusie Independent Photography Professional August 2, 2011, Jeanne was a client of Kevin’s When I have a high level project such as an Annual Report that requires a seasoned image capturing resource that is flexible, professional and who has a high comfort level of expertise shooting in a corporate environment, I always, hands down hire, Kevin Brusie Photography. He is the best. Kevin brings a breadth of expertise to the shoot and makes 'our' clients-he takes client service as seriously as I do- feel at ease that their creative objectives will be executed on strategy and on budget- every time. Also, importantly, Kevin uses his keen technical expertise, along with a host of tools and resources to achieve a successful image adaptation technically, that is critical to digital environments across the board. A true partnering of the creative process for sure...

I came to her originally looking for help in building a cohesive brand strategy so that people would be able to quickly identify my content in a river of social media. Her first draft of my brand strategy exceeded my hopes by such a large degree that I started wondering about expanding the scope of the work. Prior to working with her, I had a logo I purchased for $149 from an online logo design company. It was functional at best, but primarily uninspired and generic. I had resigned myself to thinking that there was no hope for improving my logo, but I reconsidered that belief after seeing what Jessica could do.So, prior to finishing the brand strategy, we created a new contract to also create the logo as it made much more sense to do the logo at the same time as the brand strategy rather than afterwards. One thing I greatly appreciated about Jessica was her ability to explain the rationale behind her decisions. Simply put, she saved me from myself on multiple occasions. I often wanted to make changes that would have been detrimental to the final product. She told me her thought process, and I immediately understood and agreed with her choice. After a few rounds of back and forth, the final product was amazing. It feels so unfamiliar to be exceedingly proud of my new logo after so many years of apathy. Truly, she provides amazing value. Her final brand guide was also extremely detailed and all who have seen it are thoroughly impressed. Without a doubt, I have complete faith and trust in Jessica’s ability. I have no intent of ever working with another designer. She is incredibly gifted and you’ll be thrilled with the results. Alina Anderson Engineering Operations Manager at Smartsheet January 2, 2015, Alina was a client of Jessica’s Jessica is a fantastically talented graphic designer!

Ginny was working as a Technical Writer/Editor and I was working as an Electronic Graphic Designer for their E-Learning Area. Ginny was very smart, conscientious and fast in the fulfillment of her project assignments, some of which overlapped with mine. I found her to be articulate, personable and funny, not to mention very technologically saavy. Ginny truly grew on me and my only regret is that we could not spend more time working together, at the point that her contract was finalized. After she left, I overheard many good comments about her work and how she made things so much better that it was hard to imagine how the products had been presented in their previous formats. I highly endorse her for any projects in which her skills would be of value and I would love to work with her again...

A giving associate, trainer and mentor, I commend him for the incredible number of hours and effort he has put into Forty Plus and the number of people he has reached with his support and training. Kudos to Steve for his professional insights and for ‘thinking outside of the box” for all of us! His “Negotiations Training Course” is one not to be missed. A valuable resource person, I highly recommend Steve to others.

At last night's pitch we secured second place, and won $1500 to help make this idea come to life. So what is it? Community POP’s goal is to utilize vacant lots in Vancouver to create short-term, affordable housing communities. Think tactical urbanism + site activation + tiny homes + community engagement + sustainability = affordable community. While there have been many discussions about empty homes and empty condos in Vancouver, what about empty lots? We want to partner with the City and/or land owners to activate vacant land with tiny homes to help house the hidden homeless. Now it is time for our team to regroup and start developing a strategy for what to do with the $1500 prize money. I would love to source some inspiration from people, or to shop some ideas around with other urbanist nerds! We are going to need a lot of partnerships to create temporary, affordable, pop-up communities. My hope is that we can also create some awesome long term policy/bylaw solutions that allow for temporary site activation to happen more easily.

I reported to Michelle and received feedback and changes on the designs.Michelle was fantastic to work with as a Project Manager. She was inherently driven and passionate about the initiatives, and her positive attitude shined through even the toughest of deadlines. I always felt comfortable asking questions and addressing concerns. The work that I had created was always appreciated, while also managed in a way that ensured all involved were having their needs met. As I have found, there is often tension between the designer and the managing liaison that reports all of the changes needed. I was delighted that wasn't the case at all with Michelle, and was subsequently more motivated to create successful work.

As a fellow UX Designer, Brandon’s apparent magic-wand ability to barely touch a project and have it suddenly become beautiful is both awesome to watch and yet frustrating as hell to try to compete with. In the very competitive world of tech, Brandon is great designer. Just as importantly, his dedication to making great products, without the slightest hint of personal agenda, makes him one the most enjoyable co-workers I have ever had a chance to collaborate, problem-solve and design with. Kirk Visola Sr. Graphic Designer February 7, 2012, Brandon worked with Kirk in the same group Brandon Voss is one of the most talented and hard-working people I know. He is an incredibly inept illustrator and designer. I have had the privilege of working with Brandon and have grown as a designer from knowing him. His work ethic, concepting ability, and technical capabilities are on a level that a majority of designers, including myself, have a problem trying to match. His kind disposition and great attitude make him a pleasure to be around. He always has a smile on his face and make others around him feel welcome. I am honored to endorse Mr. Voss and know with the utmost confidence that he can tackle any job for which he feels fit.

If he feels it's right to work on something then he's just going to give all his might to make his idea get real. Indirectly, but very naturally - and just because he (most of the times) loves his work - he taught me a lot about web design, about how to think in a team.. and basically how to dream and to believe in ideas. I am really really glad David trusted me when working together. I have shared great moments with him. If you have to deal with the best you can do is start the discussion about anything related to Jean-Claude Van Damme or Michael Jackson .. it'll be a good starting point :-) Tim Rosenberg Chief Operations Officer at Great British Chefs November 15, 2010, Tim was a client of David’s I worked with David during an extremely intense period of product/site development for our business.David always delivered first class results and at the same time ensured deadlines were met and the standard of work exceeded expectations.David possesses a great air of calm, a tremendous work ethic and above all an excellent understanding of what does and doesn’t work in terms of web design.I look forward to working with David again on future events and have no hesitation in recommending him.

John saw an opportunity help educate the disregarded population of newly sober drug addicts and arm them with professional skills honed during a 9 month internship training program within his company. He encouraged a culture that allowed for the interns to ignite their creativity and knowledge that inherently came from their pasts; a lifestyle that naturally put their finger on the pulse of creative, up and coming and underground pop culture trends. The end result being cutting edge concepts for campaigns and interns who are infused with a new found determination and set of skills. By leveraging the untapped resource of human capital, he has succeeded in serving his clients, society and the interns he worked with.Society has taken notice of John’s forward thinking work as evidenced by his recent invitation to speak amongst such influential people as Joel Stein of Time Magazine about the future of non-profits. In addition, John was one of four panelists at an engagement facilitated by a member of President Obama’s Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and the Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation, in coordination with the Office of Public Engagement.Today, John is continuing to offer his design and marketing skills to his clients at Sullivan Design and he also continues to be a leader, mentor, educator to men and women in recovery.As winner of the 2010 LASVP Fast Pitch competition, and founder of the company that was awarded the JCF's quarter million dollar Cutting Edge grant in 2011, this unique leader is continuing to stretch the possibilities of recovery, inspiring new others to do the same.

Tiffany worked with me in the Student Services Department as a Resident Assistant at Art Institute of Philadelphia for 3 years. She began here as Resident Assistant and was promoted to Senior resident Assistant.During Tiffany's service with me, I admired her for her many valuable qualities, and regarded her with even more respect. Very goal oriented as well as a team player, Tiffany was always punctual, yet easygoing. She was keenly devoted to her work, but being a real people person, she was also enjoyable to be around. Not only was she a co- worker but also a fellow student with me and friend.Tiffany demonstrated from early that she understood what was required from the job. She was quite aware of the bottom line, and had a knack for recognizing what was important. I suppose doing well in business is easy if you are, as she was, efficient by nature. Tiffany is always up for new challenges only because of her desire to learn and grow further. I would have loved to see her more, but certainly understand her need to advance beyond the positions.In closing, let me say I have no hesitation in recommending Tiffany Lewis for any supervisory position in marketing or the work she currently does. I feel confident she would be an asset to her organization and any other there after.Sincerely,Stephanie FieldGraphic Designer Melissa Stanchock Graphic Designer October 29, 2008, Stephanie and Melissa were students together I have had the pleasure with working along side Melissa at AIPH. She has always taken great pride and creativity in every project. She has a professional demonstration of leadership qualities and has a strong work ethic.

Tiffany worked with me in the Student Services Department as a Resident Assistant at Art Institute of Philadelphia for 3 years. She began here as Resident Assistant and was promoted to Senior resident Assistant.During Tiffany's service with me, I admired her for her many valuable qualities, and regarded her with even more respect. Very goal oriented as well as a team player, Tiffany was always punctual, yet easygoing. She was keenly devoted to her work, but being a real people person, she was also enjoyable to be around. Not only was she a co- worker but also a fellow student with me and friend.Tiffany demonstrated from early that she understood what was required from the job. She was quite aware of the bottom line, and had a knack for recognizing what was important. I suppose doing well in business is easy if you are, as she was, efficient by nature. Tiffany is always up for new challenges only because of her desire to learn and grow further. I would have loved to see her more, but certainly understand her need to advance beyond the positions.In closing, let me say I have no hesitation in recommending Tiffany Lewis for any supervisory position in marketing or the work she currently does. I feel confident she would be an asset to her organization and any other there after.Sincerely,Stephanie FieldGraphic Designer Melissa Stanchock Graphic Designer October 29, 2008, Stephanie and Melissa were students together I have had the pleasure with working along side Melissa at AIPH.

In Dreaming Sophia, she weaves many strands of Italian culture into a delightful blend of fantasy, romance, art and history. With an artist’s keen eye and deft touch, she brings to life the titans of Italian culture in a touching tale of a young woman reeling from loss who discovers that “Italy is the answer.” The many Italophiles who share her belief will revel in the adventures of this kindred spirit.Dreaming Sophia is a magical look into Italy, language, art, and culture. It is a story about turning dreams into reality and learning to walk the fine line between fact and fantasy. When tragedy strikes, Sophia finds herself alone in the world, without direction and fearful of loving again. With only her vivid imagination to guide her, she begins a journey that will take her from the vinyeards in Sonoma, California to a grad school in Philadelphia and, eventually, to Italy: Florence, Lucca, Rome, Verona, Venice, and Val d’Orcia. Through dream-like encounters, Sophia meets Italian personalities—princes, poets, duchesses, artists, and film stars—who give her advice to help put her life back together. Following a path that takes her from grief to joy, she discovers the source of her creativity and learns to love again, turning her dreams into reality.

Jann Huizenga Writer, photographer, international educator June 2, 2013, Melissa worked with Jann but at different companies The first time I "met" Jann Huizenga was when I "knocked" virtually on the door of her blog BAROQUE SICILY. I was immediately welcomed by Jann and invited into her home-away-from-home in Italy, through the luscious photos she takes, that expertly capture the people and lifestyle of Ragusa Ibla. Jann is a gifted writer, but her beautiful and evocative photos also tell such fascinating stories. As a fellow blogger about Italy, her photos capture an essence of Italy that help me to appreciate and enjoy the country, its pleasures and its idiosyncrasies all the more. It is a pleasure to follow Jann and her adventures in Southern Italy as she rebuilds a damp old house and creates a life for herself in a foreign country. Grazie per il tuo lavoro Jann! È ottimo!

Among them, Jason Beaulieu is one of the best in his field. His vision, has shaped the look and feel of a design that keeps Popeye's fresh and at the front of the pack in the industry. He possesses a natural sense of style, a vision towards future trends, and an intelligence level that, combined with his industry knowledge, makes him a leader in his field. Better yet, Jason knows how to effectively communicate with so many different personality types, which allows him to transform his vision into reality.

As the project evolved over the course of several weeks, Tracy was always quick to respond with new quotes and projections. Her suggestion for the ceramic tile turned out to be the absolute perfect match in color, size options and price. I'll be happy to work with Tracy on any future projects. Alyshea Gow Owner/Interior Designer at Feather Your Nest Interiors January 7, 2009, Jason was a client of Alyshea’s Sure, it's just laminate with a little solid surface thrown in, but working with Alyshea makes it worth while. She has been my rep for a few years now and I can always expect exceptional service from her. She's very personable and always shows up on time for updates (never unexpected). I hope to continue working with her again in the coming years.

June 1, 2009, James reported directly to Jon John is a great guiding figure in so many lives. He has the demeanor of a sage with a sharp wit and ageless curiosity. He would probably be the coolest crazy uncle a young mind could have. He understands the poetry of language and shape - and is sure to enrich anyone he is around. Nicholas Jacobs Art Director May 26, 2010, Nicholas and Jon were students together I have had the extreme pleasure of studying design with Mr. Jon Cournoyer for about three years. In that time, Jon showed my classmates and me the wonderful things that good design can do in this world. He is one of the most kind and thoughtful people I have ever met, and with these traits, he is an assest to me, my colleagues and Webster University. Not only an incredible mentor and friend, Jon's skills as a fine artist have made him an integral part of the design field in St. Louis. I am proud to have had him as my professor and I can guarantee I will never stop learning from his words, actions, designs or art.

Would STRONGLY prefer Oakland-based firms and would love to support candidates/firms that represent diversity and share my progressive values. waqar commented $100,000 a year is only $273 a day. $273 a day is only $11/hr if you have a business that is running 24 hours. If you're only working 8 hours a day...how are you supposed to make up the other 16 hours? You see...there is nothing wrong with having a job. A 9-5 pays the bills, but it's not meant to sustain you forever. Save money and invest in a business. It's time to learn how to make money in your sleep, 24/7. For things to change you have to change. Comment “Interested” and I will privately message you. waqar liked In need for a freelance graphic designer for a 5 days in-house assignment.

Elana helped me to witness the patterns that were holding me back - to see them with a new perspective - and gave me the tools to build a better life: spiritually, mentally and physically. The insight she gave me literally changed my life forever and set me on an incredible evolutionary path, that has benefited my relationships, my creativity, my work and my daily life for well over a decade. I recently circled back to Elana when I was facing my latest crisis - a lack of confidence that had reered it’s ugly head regarding my success, creativity and self worth. Within a couple of sessions, Elana had dug me out of this hole and had me standing on the mountain of dirt looking around with a renewed perspective. This recent re-engagement once again dramatically changed my life, welcoming in abundant confidence, creativity and boundless success.I am so grateful to have such a powerful mentor, guide and friend in my life and I can’t recommend Elana enough. I wish all of my friends could see her and share in the incredible benefits that her intuition, perspective, guidance and healing hands have brought me.

Kita masuk di hari H. 1. Jgn panik! Makanya jam terbang penting. Kalau ada panggilan, jgn main tolak2, meski lagi gak mau pindah. Selama sesuai bidang/passion yg Anda kejar, datangi! Kalaupun tdk sesuai, tolak dg baik & tawarkan kandidat yg Anda kenal sebagai pengganti. Bantu recruiter! 2. Ini bukan ujian utk Anda, tapi diskusi untuk mencari kecocokan. Jadi jgn pasif, nungguin pertanyaan doang, BIG no2! Jawaban Anda, jgn singkat2. Contoh: ceritakan tentang diri Anda. Biasanya kita bingung, cerita pribadi/soal pekerjaan? Jgn bingung, ceritakan keduanya! Be talkative, tapi jgn over. Bisa juga cerita, saya mempelajari perusahaan bapak/ibu, sejauh yg saya tahu saat ini peluangnya a, b, dll. Menurut saya apabila ada inisiatif seperti a, b, dll, perusahaan ini memiliki peluang utk tumbuh cepat. Konteks sharing, jgn sok ngajarin! 3. Amati pewawancara, tipe direct, gak basa basi? Friendly, suka ngobrol? Serius, bicara fakta? Atau kombinasi? Salah 1 tips membangun subyektifitas dg mirroring, orang senang ada sama orang2 yg setipe. Buat dia merasa Anda tipe dia. Hati2 dg pewawancara yg ahli, mereka bisa main peran. Selama Anda lakukan dg cantik & tdk berlebihan, oklah. Mirroring bisa dg gaya berbicara, cara berpikir, atau obrolan mengenai common interest.

I always try to push myself beyond my limits in order to accomplish my creative and professional goals in the best way.Immediately after being graduated I started my career as a digital designer in an agency in Italy. In a few months working there, I have gained invaluable experience in editorial design and social networks campaigns, as well as branding and corporate identity. I accept every possibility I get to move forward that's why now I am in London and I am ready to face new challenges.I am looking for new adventures that would allow me to use my skills, strategic thinking, creative abilities and passion for my job and to learn many more things.

I had the pleasure of working with him for only four months but for me it has become priceless working experience. In his studio I learned to manage multiple projects, to be consistent in creation of corporate identity communication graphic designs. He shared with me his proper experience and his knowledge which are very important for me in order to go on with my professional growth. Apart from the working routine, we had some good coffee breaks and jokes in order to relax before approaching new projects! I have to admit that, as leader, Luca really earns my highest recommendation.

You can see my work here: https://www.behance.net/alvcI am a graduate of Industrial Design at PUCP, 2013. Creation and design of products has always been one of my interests and the development of such a source of curiosity. My favorite part of this process is the creative management concept in a project. I have learned the creative and analytical process necessary for proper make of products, which is constantly improving as I go in my professional development. This way, I can reach more innovative and better solutions for users and developers.I also believe that a product must take into account different factors, apart from those directly involved a designer. As a professional, I know how to handle teamwork, sharing and building concepts with people from other lines of work to gain a common goal. Also, I think that not only lead to a better and more complete result, but is also an enriching experience and growth.I have been fortunate to live in different parts of Peru and travel to different parts of the world, which makes me easy to communicate and understand people from different backgrounds and realities. This has given me a global vision and a better understanding of what people may want or need, all of which are important to the ultimate success of a product.I have no favoritism when I design, but now I'm more interested in the development of 3D characters and their animation. Game research and creating new ways of learning. I want to improve my technique to make better products and I know I still have a long way to. I have worked also making 2D games and applications. On the other hand, I have been able to participate in different areas of design, industrial design: vehicles, toys, my impressions 3d modeling, etc. I won 2 StartUp Weekends Lima and a design in “Lo Inimaginalbe Posible” at UTEC.
