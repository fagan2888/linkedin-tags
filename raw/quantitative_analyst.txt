Did you know that an average American reads for less than 15 minutes a day. The average Indian reads far less than that (though no credible data exists). Students, who you would expect are avid readers, barely read anymore. Let's join hands to encourage people, especially our youth, to read. This June 7 promote good reading habits, whether it is reading a newspaper, a magazine, or a book. If Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Bill Clinton can find the time to read regularly, there is no reason why most of us can't find reading time in our lives.

Did you know that an average American reads for less than 15 minutes a day. The average Indian reads far less than that (though no credible data exists). Students, who you would expect are avid readers, barely read anymore. Let's join hands to encourage people, especially our youth, to read. This June 7 promote good reading habits, whether it is reading a newspaper, a magazine, or a book. If Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Bill Clinton can find the time to read regularly, there is no reason why most of us can't find reading time in our lives.

Eager to take on responsibilities and delegate tasks to others, Milen shows that he is able to take the lead or yield to others as well. Milen would be a valuable asset to any company. Alina Hurtado Manager, Learning & Development August 24, 2009, Alina managed Milen directly Milen and I worked together on the Executive Board of the Ballroom & Latin Dance Team at NYU; I was President and Milen served as Treasurer over the course of one academic year. Milen's position dealt with handling a $15,000 budget to cover over 70 team members. Over the course of his tenure, Milen exhibited some key characteristics that will undoubtedly help him in whatever career he will choose: exceptional communication skills when it came time to coordinate collection of forms, dues, and other paperwork from team members and handle financial logistics with various NYU offices; great time management in organizing his responsibilities over the course of the year and making sure all necessary forms, reimbursements, fees were submitted on time; and great flexibility as he was always able to pick up the role of leader if I was unable to attend a meeting. Milen also showed great teamwork as he attended every event the team held (including competitions all over the East coast) and helped manage numerous events, including our first large-scale competition. One of the most impressive things about Milen's time as Treasurer was how proactive he was about the position even though he had no prior Executive Board experience. Upon being elected, Milen reached out to the previous Treasurer to schedule a meeting and understand the intricacies of the position. Throughout the year Milen was active at team meetings about how to most effectively use the budget for team events, and had the answer to any budget-related questions other members had. By the end of the year, Milen was able to do what the prior two Treasurers had failed at doing: he was able to balance our budget and end the year with a significant credit in our account, even though this was the same year that we had held a competition that cost us close to $7,000. With all of this in mind, it was no surprise to me when Milen was elected the new team President. Having recognized these key characteristics over the course of the year, I was very confident in leaving my position and knowing that Milen would continue to improve the financial and overall performance of the team.

While her main background is front-office oriented and she is relatively new to CCR, she was very quick in learning the subject and efficiently delivered her task. I also noticed that she pays attention to the details e.g. she identified some hard-to-find errors in existing work.

Ma Private Mortgage Banking Sales Supervisor NMLS 376134 at Wells Fargo Private Mortgage Bank May 5, 2014, David was a client of Andy W.’s Andy was our mortgage banker for our first home. We had considered both Andy through Wells Fargo and also an agent through First Republic. While the initial decision to go with Andy was based on the interest rate, we soon realized how incredibly lucky we were to have Andy as our agent. At every step of the way, Andy was quick to respond to our emails, even on weekends, and he was always to the point. On the two homes where we placed offers, Andy was incredibly fast and effective. While putting an offer on a home was inherently stressful by the nature of the process, Andy did what he could to work ahead of deadlines and set our expectations for upcoming steps. He was also incredibly patient with all our questions as first-time home buyers and went above and beyond to make sure we understood each step of the process. Together with our real estate agent, who on several occasions commented on Andy’s exceptional reliability and expertise, we were able to be extremely fast on offers, counter-offers, and deadlines throughout the contract period: we were able to close in just 15 days. We can, with full confidence, recommend Andy.

View 1 more recommendation View 1 more recommendation recommendations Merell Nair Client Solutions Analyst at Barclays Africa Group Limited June 20, 2013, Dr Antonie was Merell’s mentor During 2011 Merrell was a fourth year student at Wits in the Programme in Advanced Mathematics of Finance. I supervised her project entitled "Implied Volatility skews of options on Single StockFutures." This project was very interesting where we looked at the shape and stability of the volatility surfaces for single name futures. Merrell was an outstanding student and she really excelled in all the research and computational analysis. This research project gave us new insights into the volatility skew dynamics for single name options.It was such a ground breaking piece of research that another student extended the work during 2012. This led to a research article being published in the North American Journal of Economics and Finance with Merrell being a co-author. The paper can be found at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940813000272.Merrell is a hard worker and she understands her subject field very well. I know she will excel in any of her future career paths. Tshifhango Ndadza Senior Market Risk Analyst - Public Investment Corporation March 1, 2011, Dr Antonie was Tshifhango’s mentor During 2010, Tshifhango studied at Wits. He was busy with his honours in Financial Mathematics. I helped him in choosing a topic for his project. We decided to look at volatility skews for illiquid instruments. We tried to establish a link between a liquid skew (as for the ALSI) and its constituents where there are no skews. I worked well with Tshifhango. He finished his project and was a good student, very diligent and hard working. He should achieve success in his career if he keeps that attitude.

If a recruiter calls you at work in the middle of a hectic day and you’re thinking long-term, you’ll ask for their number and call them back at a more suitable time. Many will be happy to talk to you outside of work hours. If you instead get annoyed and slam the phone down, you may have just missed out on your dream job opportunity or the chance to create a relationship with the recruiter. The purpose of my first call to a candidate isn't always to talk them into a new job, it's to connect and SCHEDULE a time to talk!

In the 10 weeks that I got to know her and work with her, Ziqi displayed unbounded enthusiasm, a solid base of modeling and programming skills, and intellectual creativity not usually found in financial modeling "nerds." Unlike most interns who were assigned one project to complete in the 2 plus month period, Ziqi was asked to work on multiple projects touching upon different stages of modeling: data, model selection,validation, expert judgment overlays. She approached each project with truly unbridled enthusiasm and used her broad set of analytical skills to tackle each challenge successfully. When she did run into an obstacle, she showed unique and creative problem skills to overcome them. For all these reasons and more, I believe Ziqi would make a valuable addition to any Financial Modeling team. Teresa Winer Actuary, Office of Insurance and Fire Safety Commissioner August 15, 2015, Tony managed Teresa directly Teresa and I worked together at Risk Lighthouse from 2011 to 2012. Teresa was the ultimate professional in the world of high stress boutique consulting.

Within just three months, Yihuan was already playing a significant role on our multifamily team, and handling marketing research tasks, transactional analysis work, as well as asset valuation and financial underwriting tasks, which was even unexpected to us in such a short time.

The 5 behind them are also among the strongest & best; they are tasked to protect the back side if there is an attack. The last one is the LEADER. He ensures that no one is left behind.

October 23, 2011, Steven and Tasneem Zehra were students together At a very young age, Tasneem impressively qualified to participate in the challenging ICTP's post-graduate Diploma Program designed for young promising students around the world. Indeed she was the most junior member amongst the 31 students in the 3 programs in theoretical physics and pure mathematics. Studying alongside her, I was impressed that while most of us at her age would be struggling with linear algebra and variational calculus, she was acquiring quantum field theories, general relativity, and Lie algebra effortlessly. Later she tackled difficult subjects such as supersymmtery and superstring with skills and ease. Her passion for physics is unquestionable. On top of that, I enjoyed Tasneem's pleasant character and great sense of humor.

We investigate alternative explanations of hedging and coordinated liquidity trading. Tests including those utilizing differences in put and call options, open interest around the settlement, and a similar volatility contract with an entirely different settlement procedure in Europe are inconsistent with these explanations but consistent with market manipulation. Large transient deviations in prices demonstrate the importance of settlement design.

As I explained to her that her co-payment was over $3000 for her cancer meds she sobbed. I could barely make out her words but as she described her situation I began to tear also. Her spouse died earlier in the year. Her son was attending the last year of graduate school and it was clear she could not afford the meds. As I heard her describe her situation I could not help but imagine myself alone. Sick and stuck with all these problems. I thank God that the co-payment assistance team at Accredo - An Express Scripts Company was able to get her the medication absolutely FREE. If I have nothing else in this career I have the privilege of helping out such a kind soul. Jane liked Apple, Google, Autodesk leaders pledge to uphold Paris agreement Jane liked I have been fortunate to interview dozens of fantastic potential employees over the past couple of months. But I can count on one hand, how many of those sent a post-interview 'Thank You' email. It's a small gesture, but means a lot.

Fast forward many months: Big Data has exploded; Cloudera has raised nearly a billion dollars and is on the front page of every business publication; the world was beating a path to his door. And yet few days after the announcement, he showed me around his lab. I brought a friend with me who had confessed he really wanted to see it too. And you know what? _He made us feel like kings._ That nothing in the world was more important then the hours he spent discussing research and answering our questions. Neither of us are Valley bigshots or had contracts on offer, and really were just curious. It was just an act of grace and humanity and cool as hell.

More Actions Ryan J. has a account Ryan J. Price Quantitative Analyst, M.Sci. Aggio Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville Greater St. Louis Area 100 100 connections Send InMail In 2013, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Economics & Finance from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, from which I graduated with honors. In August 2014, I obtained my Master's degree in the same fields, with a particular interest in applied econometrics. During my undergraduate studies (and on and off following), I was fortunate enough to serve on the management team of a small restaurant business for five years. I was able to contribute much to their astronomic growth & success over that period, and still enjoy meeting with current management on issues regarding staffing as well as growth. During my graduate studies, I was on the team representing SIUE that took home the First Place prize in the ACG Cup Competition for the St. Louis Chapter. I also received awards from the university for my scholarship & research, with papers covering the Nordic Model in Sweden, and the demography of proxied immigrant wages. Additionally, I served as an assistant to the director of the International Trade Center, and aided small manufacturing businesses in the St Louis area with export planning and various research projects. After accepting an internship with them over the summer of 2014, I worked for 2 years as a quantitative analyst at Jefferson Davis Associates, a market research firm. There, I applied my skills in economics, econometrics, & data science to the research we performed for our clients.

More Actions Ryan J. has a account Ryan J. Price Quantitative Analyst, M.Sci. Aggio Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville Greater St. Louis Area 100 100 connections Send InMail In 2013, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Economics & Finance from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, from which I graduated with honors. In August 2014, I obtained my Master's degree in the same fields, with a particular interest in applied econometrics. During my undergraduate studies (and on and off following), I was fortunate enough to serve on the management team of a small restaurant business for five years. I was able to contribute much to their astronomic growth & success over that period, and still enjoy meeting with current management on issues regarding staffing as well as growth. During my graduate studies, I was on the team representing SIUE that took home the First Place prize in the ACG Cup Competition for the St. Louis Chapter. I also received awards from the university for my scholarship & research, with papers covering the Nordic Model in Sweden, and the demography of proxied immigrant wages. Additionally, I served as an assistant to the director of the International Trade Center, and aided small manufacturing businesses in the St Louis area with export planning and various research projects. After accepting an internship with them over the summer of 2014, I worked for 2 years as a quantitative analyst at Jefferson Davis Associates, a market research firm. There, I applied my skills in economics, econometrics, & data science to the research we performed for our clients. I also developed statistical tools to take the headache out of data analysis & prediction for those without the time to interpret it themselves. Our business unit was purchased internally from Jefferson Davis in June 2016, and now I continue much of the same work at what is now called Aggio, a company focused on enterprise data solutions (i.e. business intelligence) for large agricultural companies.

Fast forward many months: Big Data has exploded; Cloudera has raised nearly a billion dollars and is on the front page of every business publication; the world was beating a path to his door. And yet few days after the announcement, he showed me around his lab. I brought a friend with me who had confessed he really wanted to see it too. And you know what? _He made us feel like kings._ That nothing in the world was more important then the hours he spent discussing research and answering our questions. Neither of us are Valley bigshots or had contracts on offer, and really were just curious. It was just an act of grace and humanity and cool as hell.

Right from the get go, her passion and enthusiasm for the position was evident. Her infectious personality made each session one I look forward to. She engaged all of us through the use of various forms of media (both print and digital) to illustrate the various leadership concepts. Natalie was also extremely effective at facilitating discussions and providing us with key points that help us probe deeper into the said concepts. Through this, we were able to share our personal experiences with each other and learn from one another.The class left a lasting impact on me. Until today I still recall the lessons I have learnt there. A big part of that is down to Natalie not just teaching us these leadership concepts but also embodying them through her own personal actions. Her commitment also extends past the boundaries of the classroom walls. Outside of those four walls, she has provided me with invaluable advice and support as I continue to adapt to life away from home.In any capacity, I am confident that Natalie would do an outstanding job because of her strong work ethic, passion for the job and her ability to empower others around her to be the best that they can be.

The graders do not give preference or discriminate against the candidates based on race, color, national origin, gender, or religion. The requirements for the exam takers are pure and simple.

I had the pleaseure to work directly with Julie for the last 4.5 yrs. Simply put, Julie is a "gamer!" Julie proved herself to be a knowledgeable and reliable worker and someone, even though she worked remotely, you do not have to ever think twice about. Her focus in servering our client was primarily in the corporate /shared services divisions, including, GSM, HR, IT, Finance, and Legal. She excelled. She more than just recruited talent to challenging locations across the U.S. She also was able to provide market intelligence that allowed our hiring managers to make decisions on hiring needs and their overall approach to talent. Julie also is someone that can interact with hiring managers. She provides confidence and process excellence in everything she does. Lastly, Julie was one of my senior recrutiers that I always leaned on to train others and pilot new recruitment techniques and/or tools. She always "just gets it." As a leader, I could not ask for more. Again, it is with pleasure that I extend this recommendation on behalf of Julie Sutton. Jessica Plunkett, SPHR, SHRM-SCP Finance HR Manager at Corning Inc. April 21, 2017, Jessica was a client of Julie’s Julie is one of the best and hardest working recruiters I've ever worked with in my career. She makes recruiting look easy and we all know that's not the case! Julie understands the roles she is looking to fill and asks insightful questions to get to the root of who the hiring manager is looking to bring on board. She also bridges hiring managers and candidates to make the best possible connections for both parties. I hope to get the chance to work with Julie again.

CHARLES,’s Articles & Activity Sr. Acquisition Program Analyst Immediate Opening DEBRA F. CHARLES, CQF, MSF, MSIS, DAWIA on LinkedIn See 694 more articles How to identify smart people: They ask you questions. When you answer, they ask you more. When you start using big words, they ask for clarification. When they can’t understand anything you’re saying, they ask for you to explain it to them as if they were a five-year-old. When you say something intriguing, they write it down in their notebook or phone. These people are not naturally more intelligent. They’re better learners which makes them more intelligent. Why do they learn better? They’re genuinely curious and ask questions from a humble standpoint. I’ve met highly successful people who’ve said, “explain it to me as if I were a five-year-old.” This simple phrase has changed my life when it comes to learning. It comes back to the famous Chinese proverb: “He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever." As soon as you stop asking questions, you stop learning. As soon as you stop writing down ideas, you forget them. The hardest part of becoming intelligent is not bullshitting yourself about what you know; it’s being humble enough to ask questions. If you can do this, then people will see you as intelligent, too.

She is very detail-oriented in her model validation approach and is often able to identify weakness or implementation issue within the models she has validated. She's not shy of reverting her concern of model limitations back to the front office quants or risk managers. I highly appreciate the thoroughness of her model validation approach, and expect her to continue to do well in this important functional area of the risk management organization. Shujun Alex Lu, CFA Vice President at Citi June 8, 2016, Shujun Alex worked with Jinhua (echo) in different groups I have worked with Jinhua on 4 models in the past 2 years.

Together we developed some statistical techniques (lead-lag, PCA etc) to evaluate vendor data quality in fixed income. Arianna has a very impressive breadth of skills, across the range of statistics and data science algorithms, as well as strong technical abilities, both on the data and coding sides. She was able to grasp sophisticated concepts of quantitative analytics from scratch and start using them in a very short time.

Shrimay liked If I only got to ask a few questions about a person, I'd ask about qualities like their ability to help others, be empathetic, and hang in there even when times get tough. These are the qualities that matter and people who operate this way will always find ways to connect with each other. In order to be positive about the future, I have to believe that kindness, respect, compassion, and tenacity will prevail. This does not mean that I will always get my way. It simply implies that I will be proud of myself and my community for the ways that we interact with each other and treat other people. I don't treasure friends—or colleagues—simply because they always think like I do. I treasure those who can be kind and decent to people who think very differently than they do. Here's why kindness matters so much... Human beings are prone to errors. We all make mistakes. Our ability to predict the future is feeble. Just because you believe something is true... does not mean it is true. No matter how fervently you believe that YOU are right, the odds are pretty good that you are wrong. But there are certain core values that will never steer you wrong, and I've mentioned them here. Try being a tad kinder and don't worry so much about being "right".

I can enthusiastically recommend him on several levels. It would be difficult to find an analyst who has run more customized optimizations, evaluated more institutional portfolios, or provided more insightful recommendations on hedging factor exposures and controlling portfolio risk. His expertise in applied portfolio theory is considerable, but what sets Leon apart are his people skills. Because of his easygoing and unassuming demeanor, colleagues enjoy working with him, and clients seek him out, making him particularly effective at building client relationships.

Deborah Price LLB, MA Senior Consultant at Teletech Consulting January 6, 2012, Zhen worked with Deborah but at different companies Deborah was both my instructor and mentor for the Advanced Management Program in 2011. She was very approachable which allowed me to develop a quick sense of trust. As a mentor, she not only shared her experience and advice but also encouraged me to come up with my own solutions. She carefully paired me up with another senior manager in the program which greatly enhanced my experience. I believe that Deborah’s proficiency set the stage for a successful and rewarding experience.

Stephen Lau IT Support Manager at Harvard Kennedy School of Government December 28, 2009, Richard reported directly to Stephen I first met Stephen in my freshman year when he hired me as part of the work-study program at Boston University. Prior to this job, I had no IT experience whatsoever and was just one of those kids that had an interest in computers. Stephen made it a very easy transition for me by being easy to talk to and by taking the time to make sure I learned about what it was I was working on. He assigned many tasks for me, but also allowed me to work at my own pace. After working there over the duration of my first school year, he offered me a part-time job over the summer in which I helped him support some external locations.

As an entrepreneur, I find Vikram to be a person of immense self-belief and unwavering motivation. He is resolute in his approach yet receptive to new ideas.

Po is dedicated to education, which is evident in everything he does. I've been especially pleased with his humility despite being a prolific mathematician. He is incredibly self-aware, and is unafraid to seek out support when needed. He has been a pleasure to work with and I am constantly amazed by his sheer hustle and will to get things done. One small example is of a math competition that was supposed to happen at Stanford that ended up getting almost canceled due to a logistical issue. Through his contacts and quick thinking, Po was able to relocate and rebrand the math competition, ensuring that it happened successfully with full attendance. Po continues to excel in everything he does and I look forward to continued work with this stellar founder.

He assigned many tasks for me, but also allowed me to work at my own pace. After working there over the duration of my first school year, he offered me a part-time job over the summer in which I helped him support some external locations.

Brendan excelled in each of these efforts and was a true asset to our graduate program and my research group. Brendan's leadership and dedication was invaluable in helping me as a young Assistant Professor to build my research group into an organization of significance in robotics. Kalaichelvi Paramanathan Business Intelligence and Big Data Analytics Consultant March 27, 2010, Kalaichelvi managed Brendan directly I was Brendan’s immediate supervisor during his tenure at Barclays Capital. I found him to be extra ordinary, self motivated, hard working, honest and tackling all assignments with dedication. It has been a pleasure working with Brendan. Besides being a joy to work with, Brendan took charge in whatever he did. He was able to present creative ideas and developed tools that have helped traders efficiently manage their books hence increased revenue. Brendan was an asset to our business unit. I highly recommend Brendan for employment. He is a team player and would make a great asset to any organization.

Python pandas and Machine Learning. A passion for functional programming and little time left to code serious Haskell. Highlights Follow Follow Roberto’s Activity 754 followers Hallo, I have a question for the ARPM - Advanced Risk and Portfolio Management group and for Attilio Meucci: Suppose you have a time series y_t explained in terms of an AR process with some exogenous variables x1_t, ..., xk_t (for example an ARIMAX model). Let's say the model works well on short time intervals (the auto correlation function decays after a few lags). Now imagine I change scenario: I want to say something on the distribution of y_t projecting on a long time horizon. Can I somehow exploit the the ARIMAX relation on the short time scale to say something on the long time scale? A few things I can think of: mixture of distributions of the exogenous variables, hidden Markov model, Black-Litterman-Meucci (the empirical distribution of y_t is the prior and it gets tweaked with views obtained by projecting the distributions of the exogenous vars on the horizon), ... Any help is greatly appreciated.

Let's say the model works well on short time intervals (the auto correlation function decays after a few lags). Now imagine I change scenario: I want to say something on the distribution of y_t projecting on a long time horizon. Can I somehow exploit the the ARIMAX relation on the short time scale to say something on the long time scale? A few things I can think of: mixture of distributions of the exogenous variables, hidden Markov model, Black-Litterman-Meucci (the empirical distribution of y_t is the prior and it gets tweaked with views obtained by projecting the distributions of the exogenous vars on the horizon), ... Any help is greatly appreciated.

It’s understanding that one view is better than zero and that humility and patience is the foundation for success. The time it takes to get your foot in the door at the biggest companies in the world is often years and years of hard work.

Highlights Follow Follow Vukosi Era’s Activity 550 followers Retail sales volumes grew by 1.5%y/y at the beginning of 2Q17 from 0.9% in March and marks the fastest pace of growth since December 2016. However, the headline figure masks the underlying weakness as four of the seven subsectors, which account for 52% of the sector contracted by between 1.6%y/y and 5.0%y/y. The only three sub-sectors that registered positive growth are general dealers (5.1%y/y); food, beverages and tobacco (13.6%y/y) and pharmaceutical and medical goods and cosmetics (2.7%y/y). All considered, the print is good but the growth is concentrated in three big sectors which are likely to curve in as well given the general weakness in domestic demand. The weakness in the other four sub-sectors does not bod well for growth. Meanwhile, the RMB/BER business confidence released earlier today showed a 11 point decline to 29 during 2Q17 from 40 in 1Q17. Besides the sharp decline in the headline figure, all five subsectors declined and they are also all below 50 points – the neutral level. The last time we saw these levels was during the 2009 financial crisis.

It’s understanding that one view is better than zero and that humility and patience is the foundation for success. The time it takes to get your foot in the door at the biggest companies in the world is often years and years of hard work.

As a global energy executive with expertise in power trading and hedging, PPAs, and the integration of renewable / alternative energy technologies, I've been successful in adopting disruptive business models into the energy ecosystem. (Exicted about Microgrids and Blockchain future applications too!) My energy career started with NextEra Energy (FPL ENERGY) in roles as a Quantitative Analyst, Trader, Portfolio Manager, and P&L manager of generation assets. I was then recruited to lead teams developing utility-scale wind farms for a Morgan Stanley Venture and Gamesa Energy in the US, Mexico, and the Caribbean. My current team (back at NextEra) manages the analysis and implementation of the next-generation energy ecosystem integrating Demand Response products and services, efficiency, battery storage, and distributed generation. In these roles as a VP / Director, I was tapped to lead strategic initiatives, develop new energy sites, originate and structure deals to manage risk, financings, and corporate development. I've led cross-functional teams including sales, finance, legal, and operations responsibilities and leveraged this knowledge to communicate solutions to problems using new complex technologies, concepts, and processes in a format that is easily understood by customers and stakeholders. Results: As a leader, team member, and change agent I have a successful track record of complex transactions, acquisitions, and developed producing assets. I've been fortunate to develop a network across the energy industry including energy traders for multiple commodities, VC's, manufacturers, consultants, banks, and utility partners. _____ Phone: (561) 351-9886 Email: rcmelley@gmail.com See moreSee more of undefined summary Highlights Follow Follow Christopher’s Articles & Activity 5,450 followers HBR: How Your Energy Strategy Can Create a Competitive Advantage Christopher Melley on LinkedIn See 1 more article Tanja Stadnic’s photo Christopher liked Lauren Hepler offers some insights into the future models of sustainable solutions for remote islands.

I wanted to learn differential geometry. The subject touches upon areas which I enjoy, such as advanced calculus, group theory, linear algebra, and point-set topology. In all aspects of working together, I found Philip to be exemplary. He came well-prepared for the lesson each time. He set out our plan based on his experience with a standard course. I would bring the more challenging exercises to our sessions. If I struggled at the blackboard, he would steer me through difficult sections without losing patience. He was able to identify lapses in my understanding and meet them with lucid explanations on the spot. While it may be easy to explain a geometric topic geometrically, an abstract one can often elude the best of teachers. Not Philip. Whether venturing into Gaussian curvature or topological manifolds, he was able to put them in concrete terms by drawing pictures or making analogies to simpler concepts. His explanations made the difference between confusion and clarity. He encouraged best practice. Doing proofs requires good logical "hygiene", clear use of symbols, and succinct reasoning. His instruction helped me with even these subtler aspects of doing proofs. He was able to impart this advice in a constructive way, without any of the arrogance which people typically associate with math tutors operating at his level. Armed with this know-how, I feel better-prepared for entry into an upcoming pure mathematics program. I would recommend Philip wholeheartedly.

Thanks! --- I love to find the big opportunities that have been overlooked and figure out how to create value. ---------------------- I grew up on a small farm in Maine. We didn't have the Interwebs or even a local BBS that I could dial, so I taught myself programming mainly to avoid working in the fields. It sort of worked on both counts. I still got stuck with farm work, which turned out to be writing database programs for my dad. My first entrepreneurial venture was to collect juniper berries (which grew on the back side of Hedgehog Hill). I started my first real business when I was 16, a landscaping company, and my second at 18, a wholesale business. I always remind myself, no matter how tough the job, it's not as bad as haying.

His knowledge of inflation and interest rates is vast. His enthusiasm for continuing to improve the field and options to better serve the investing public with the currently available products and an eye for developing new and improved investment vehicles can only be described as evangelic. Mike's advise and ability to review and explain high level ideas makes him an ideal person to go to for help. Mike has a high level of integrity, and a strong sense of fairness, that has made it possible for me and many others to share ideas and get his valuable opinion. Ronit Walny, CFA Managing Director at Neuberger Berman April 16, 2010, Michael managed Ronit directly Ronit is a 'true believer' in the inflation-linked products space and well-schooled in the workings of TIPS and other inflation structures. I had the opportunity to work with her both as a direct manager when she worked for my company, and later when we worked together on a project as a joint-venture between Natixis (where I was) and MacroMarkets (where she was). She's sharp, hard-working, perceptive, and seems to know everyone. In addition to inflation, where I have direct knowledge of her acumen, she has since developed expertise in structuring, equity analytics, and market-making as well as God knows what else. She is a go-getter, and a lot of fun to be around as her energy is infectious. She would be a great addition to any firm. Oleg Kostko Consultant at Stone Ridge Asset Management March 7, 2009, Michael worked with Oleg in different groups I worked with Oleg during our mutual tenure at Natixis, during which time he and his group supported the trading functions of me and my group there. Natixis has just had one of those Reduction-In-Force episodes where they are cutting muscle as well as fat. Oleg is muscle. I can testify as to Oleg's formidable problem-solving ability, his willingness to work hard to produce the desired result, and his pleasant demeanor while doing so. He worked on some complex problems with Summit's implementation of inflation analytics for Natixis (that is, for me) and with some other problems outside of Summit.

Under the leadership of a new CEO, the company had invested millions of dollars in a new product. This company had positioned its other products successfully and had revolutionized an industry. Using persistence and professional investigative questioning, Ruth interviewed numerous stakeholders including engineers and plant managers at global companies.She received mixed feedback and did not think that the new product was a slam dunk success.We knew this company’s products were always met with resistance before being widely accepted. We asked OnCall Research to dig deeper. Ruth discovered the new product was not working as planned. Within two months the company pulled the product. We were surprised, but pleased we had been warned. Ruth is an excellent interviewer and delivers on work quickly with hard to reach data. I highly recommend her.

His knowledge of inflation and interest rates is vast. His enthusiasm for continuing to improve the field and options to better serve the investing public with the currently available products and an eye for developing new and improved investment vehicles can only be described as evangelic. Mike's advise and ability to review and explain high level ideas makes him an ideal person to go to for help. Mike has a high level of integrity, and a strong sense of fairness, that has made it possible for me and many others to share ideas and get his valuable opinion. Ronit Walny, CFA Managing Director at Neuberger Berman April 16, 2010, Michael managed Ronit directly Ronit is a 'true believer' in the inflation-linked products space and well-schooled in the workings of TIPS and other inflation structures. I had the opportunity to work with her both as a direct manager when she worked for my company, and later when we worked together on a project as a joint-venture between Natixis (where I was) and MacroMarkets (where she was). She's sharp, hard-working, perceptive, and seems to know everyone. In addition to inflation, where I have direct knowledge of her acumen, she has since developed expertise in structuring, equity analytics, and market-making as well as God knows what else. She is a go-getter, and a lot of fun to be around as her energy is infectious. She would be a great addition to any firm. Oleg Kostko Consultant at Stone Ridge Asset Management March 7, 2009, Michael worked with Oleg in different groups I worked with Oleg during our mutual tenure at Natixis, during which time he and his group supported the trading functions of me and my group there. Natixis has just had one of those Reduction-In-Force episodes where they are cutting muscle as well as fat. Oleg is muscle. I can testify as to Oleg's formidable problem-solving ability, his willingness to work hard to produce the desired result, and his pleasant demeanor while doing so. He worked on some complex problems with Summit's implementation of inflation analytics for Natixis (that is, for me) and with some other problems outside of Summit. Oleg was a friendly and capable coworker and I'd be delighted to be so lucky as to meet others like him in the future. I just don't think there are very many like him.

At the time she was hired, changes in the industry required substantial revisions to the modeling and forecasting processes. With Jing’s leadership in quantitative development we were able to successfully redesign the modeling approach in a record amount of time while working in a stressful environment under tight deadlines. Unlike many quants, Jing possesses excellent communication and leadership skills. While doing hands-on work in model development, Jing was able to build a team of qualified analysts from ground up (including hiring and training). Jing is an excellent manager who devotes time to team building and employee development. She is well liked by her employees, peers and management. Jing is also a self-motivated and an effective learner. She is very passionate about her career and is continuously and proactively expanding her skills. With her diverse skills, she has a lot to offer to any team and I feel fortunate that she was on mine. Wei Chen, PhD, FRM Director Stress Testing Solutions at SAS April 22, 2010, Wei managed Jing directly I was Jing's manager when she worked at SAS for the risk management solution for the banking industry. The solution covers many aspects of credit, market, asset and liability as well as enterprise risk management. It had a very broad requirement in terms of the domain knowledge, analytical and programming skills. Jing could always timely execute her assignment with high quality and innovation. Jing was often ready to take initiative and leadership roles in certain projects. She communicated clearly financial and risk insights of the models to her colleagues. Overall she was a valuable member of the team. View 1 more recommendation View 1 more recommendation recommendations Zhongting (Vivian) Li, CFA, FRM VP, Risk Manager at JPMorgan Chase August 8, 2015, Jing managed Zhongting (Vivian) directly I recruited and managed Vivian at JPM. She was a great asset to the team and was very pleasant to work with. She's very self motivated and eager to learn. I was very impressed with her progress - in the two years we worked together, she quickly ramped up industry knowledge, made steady progress toward her pursuit of CFA and FRM designations, further improved her technical skills, and built up people skills to work effectively in a fast paced environment. With all that she earned herself excellent performance reviews and promotions; she earned respect from managers and peers and started to mentor and manage junior members, which she did very successfully. I highly recommend Vivian and strongly believe she can succeed at any organization with her unbeatable work ethics and versatile skills. Stas Melnikov Director, Investment Risk at Russell Investments June 21, 2011, Jing reported directly to Stas Stas managed me in JPMC and had a huge positive impact on me. I considered it a privilege to work for him and to have learned from him. As an inspiring leader, Stas led by example and demonstrated unmatched dedication and extreme efficiency. Stas was remarkably skillful to communicate with and motivate team members with very different backgrounds; the team felt empowered and the morale was high. Everyone felt proud to be a member of Stas' team. Stas was a leader with integrity - very honest and trustworthy in dealing with senior managers, peers, and reports. He made the team feel safe, happy, and energized. Stas developed me by setting high expectations, encouraging my initiatives, and giving me timely feedbacks and suggestions. I made great progress during the time I worked for him, especially on time management and leadership skills. As an invigorating leader and thoughtful mentor, Stas has my highest appreciation and recommendation.

At the time she was hired, changes in the industry required substantial revisions to the modeling and forecasting processes. With Jing’s leadership in quantitative development we were able to successfully redesign the modeling approach in a record amount of time while working in a stressful environment under tight deadlines. Unlike many quants, Jing possesses excellent communication and leadership skills. While doing hands-on work in model development, Jing was able to build a team of qualified analysts from ground up (including hiring and training). Jing is an excellent manager who devotes time to team building and employee development. She is well liked by her employees, peers and management. Jing is also a self-motivated and an effective learner. She is very passionate about her career and is continuously and proactively expanding her skills. With her diverse skills, she has a lot to offer to any team and I feel fortunate that she was on mine. Wei Chen, PhD, FRM Director Stress Testing Solutions at SAS April 22, 2010, Wei managed Jing directly I was Jing's manager when she worked at SAS for the risk management solution for the banking industry. The solution covers many aspects of credit, market, asset and liability as well as enterprise risk management. It had a very broad requirement in terms of the domain knowledge, analytical and programming skills. Jing could always timely execute her assignment with high quality and innovation. Jing was often ready to take initiative and leadership roles in certain projects. She communicated clearly financial and risk insights of the models to her colleagues. Overall she was a valuable member of the team.

She was a great asset to the team and was very pleasant to work with. She's very self motivated and eager to learn. I was very impressed with her progress - in the two years we worked together, she quickly ramped up industry knowledge, made steady progress toward her pursuit of CFA and FRM designations, further improved her technical skills, and built up people skills to work effectively in a fast paced environment. With all that she earned herself excellent performance reviews and promotions; she earned respect from managers and peers and started to mentor and manage junior members, which she did very successfully. I highly recommend Vivian and strongly believe she can succeed at any organization with her unbeatable work ethics and versatile skills. Stas Melnikov Director, Investment Risk at Russell Investments June 21, 2011, Jing reported directly to Stas Stas managed me in JPMC and had a huge positive impact on me. I considered it a privilege to work for him and to have learned from him. As an inspiring leader, Stas led by example and demonstrated unmatched dedication and extreme efficiency. Stas was remarkably skillful to communicate with and motivate team members with very different backgrounds; the team felt empowered and the morale was high. Everyone felt proud to be a member of Stas' team. Stas was a leader with integrity - very honest and trustworthy in dealing with senior managers, peers, and reports. He made the team feel safe, happy, and energized. Stas developed me by setting high expectations, encouraging my initiatives, and giving me timely feedbacks and suggestions. I made great progress during the time I worked for him, especially on time management and leadership skills. As an invigorating leader and thoughtful mentor, Stas has my highest appreciation and recommendation.

Minulla on vaikeuksia löytää sanoja, sillä olen vieläkin vähän tolaltani, mutta yritän parhaani. Minä olin se, joka kysyi xxx ja joka pidätteli itkua vastauksesi jälkeen. Olen tässä jo kohta vuosikymmenen kärsinyt vaihtelevan asteisesta masennuksesta, mistä on aiheutunut se, että elän tosi vahvasti oman pääni sisällä. Se taas vaikuttaa siihen, että minun on vaikea tuntea minkäänlaista yhteyttä muihin ihmisiin. Sinun läsnäolosi ja miten kohtasit meidät sai kuitenkin aikaan sen, että tunsin tulevani hetkeksi piirun verran pois mieleni syövereistä ja takaisin tätä maailmaa kohti. Se oli järisyttävää, enkä ole vastaavaa kokenut pitkiin aikoihin. Huomasin myös ettei minua pelottanut laisinkaan kysyä sinulta mitään, vaikka yleensä itsensä nolaamisen pelko ynnä muut epävarmuudet ovat aina läsnä tilanteessa kuin tilanteessa. Muutenkin kokemuksesi itsesi kehittämisestä ja muut käsittelemäsi aiheet loivat uskoa tulevaisuuteen, jota on ollut ajoittain vaikea edes ajatella tähän asti. Aloin myös harkita osallistumista xxx, mistä on monilla hyviä kokemuksia, mutta ei ole aiemmin juolahtanut mieleenikään, että voisin itsekin sinne mennä!

Sandeep Verma Data Scientist at Tavant Technologies June 15, 2015, Chad managed Sandeep directly Sandeep is a uniquely talented, diligent, and thoughtful individual and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to manage and work closely with him for several (4?) years at Zyme Solutions. During that time, Sandeep wore a number of different hats, both managerial and technical, and excelled at all things presented to him. I particularly appreciate Sandeep's strong communication and problem solving skills, which made it possible for us to work together effectively across an ocean and 11 time zones.
