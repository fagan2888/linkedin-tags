I really wish executives would realize the mistake in doing this sort of thing. Working with one team is ideal, two teams I can totally understand and get behind, three teams is difficult but I've done it (ineffectively), but four teams is just not realistic. No one can manage a schedule for four teams as a Scrum Master and be fully effective. It's time we put a stop to this poor way of thinking and stick to just one or two teams per SM.

I've worked on a spectrum of projects ranging from database systems for banks and universities to iPhone apps for startups to embedded device development for established businesses to distributed highly-available frameworks. The similarity was that there were exciting projects that needed skilled technology people to strap them together in record time.Specialties: Programming (C/C++, Python, Perl, C#, Java, Ruby, Objective C, x86 assembler, Pascal, all forms of SQL, etc.), operating environments (Windows, UNIX/Linux, Mac, smart and less-smart mobile phones, smelly basements), Windows/Linux device drivers, writing specifications, setting up interactive 3D demos with nothing but a chessboard and a roll of duct-tape, convincing management that this technology is a good idea, being the tech guy everyone approaches at parties thrown by venture capitalists.I don't update this page and I do a lot of new stuff.

This gives him a lot of tools to pick from for any given project. Don't be fooled though, his breadth doesn't come at the cost of depth. Luke is deeply technical at scalable systems, AWS, and fault-tolerant design among others.Leadership wise - Luke served as one of the incident commanders in his time at Netflix. His dedication to the role and relentless execution made him one of the best we had. At one point the he was one of only 3 incident commanders in rotation.

These requirements were far beyond the package we had at the time, and we needed a fast turnaround and a good price in order for our bid to remain competitive.We contacted several different insurance brokers, all of whom took either an inordinate amount of time to give back results, or began quoting prices in excess of twice of what I expected the costs to be.Olivier was contacted two days before the due date for our bid resubmission expired. He was able to meet this deadline with a quote, and the quote came in 10% below what we expected! We were thrilled to work with Olivier and wouldn't hesitate to contact him for renewals or expanded insurance policies - it was our pleasure!

Cassidy Williams is a super star when it comes down to working with people and sharing any message to different developer audiences all over the world, as she really understands the developer mindset, can adapt to different situations in order to deliver amazing results. Thanks for teaching me VIM Cassidy :P Sue Choe Progressive People Leader for tech start-ups August 19, 2015, Sue was senior to Cassidy but didn’t manage directly Cassidy is a wonderful Dev Evangelist: she's charismatic, passionate about teaching/mentoring others, demonstrates super-human work ethic, is an engaging public speaker, and proactively supports products she believes in. Examples of each: ** Charisma: if you meet her, you'll know what I'm talking about. Her warmth and enthusiasm naturally draw people in.** Passionate about teaching/mentoring: I always felt that her goal in attending hackathons was 50% to represent Venmo, and 50% to spread her love of software development. She actively mentors people at hackathons and in the tech community, and played a fantastic mentor to our summer intern.** Work ethic: For Cassidy, the work is never done, and she likes it that way. She is a web developer and Dev Evangelist. She spends many weekends at hackathons on her own. At Venmo, no one told her she had to go to hackathons. That's something she decided to do on her own, and with our blessing.** Public speaker: She's a frequent speaker at hackathons, tech community meetups, etc. And has no qualms with off-the-cuff presentations.** Support for product: A group of us went to a late dinner after an event. On our way to our table, Cassidy introduced the bouncer and the waiter to Venmo. She asked, "Do you know what Venmo is?" And when she detected hesitation, she whipped out her phone, and took them through a quick tutorial of Venmo, including sending money to another member of our group. And she does this with other apps that she thinks are amazing. That's just Cassidy.

August 19, 2015, Cassidy worked with Demian in different groups Demian is an excellent developer and designer. I've worked with him both in a professional setting as a fellow developer evangelist, and also in a competitive environment when Demian was on my team at the TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon. He has an eye for design and is incredibly detail oriented. Our team would not have done well without his mobile expertise and his ability to make our user experience great. I highly recommend Demian as a team player, a hard worker, and a quality person to have around. Rane Johnson-Stempson Principal Research Director, Microsoft Research September 7, 2013, Cassidy worked with Rane but at different companies Rane is one of the best things to happen to the women in tech industry in a while. With her continued efforts in mentoring, working with NCWIT, producing international women's hackathons... one has to wonder how she does it all! She's my role model and my mentor, and I'm very proud to know her.

Cindy helped us at every stage of our home purchase, at first acting as a valuable sounding board for our initial financial considerations, later giving us her sincere and well-informed advice throughout the house-hunting phase, and most importantly, guiding us through the complex process of negotiating an offer, and helping us to manage the interactions between all parties (sellers, lenders, realtors, appraisors, etc.). We truly could not have done it without her, and still call on her for advice to this day!

He does not only have a great sense of building quality products, but also has deep experience in systems designs. And he uses his knowledge to challenge, help, and guide his team members. Suffice it to say that many of our projects wouldn't be as successful without his involvement. As a co-worker, Sudhir is a fun-loving person and very easy to work with.

I'm a quick learner with a versatile skillset and a hunger for knowledge.Over the past 20 years, my eagerness to create interesting and useful software has powered my drive to learn everything I can. From BASIC at age 9 to the more recent developments in Node.js, Elixir, React, and Flux, I've devoured various technologies with keen interest. Although web programming is my specialty, I am interested in the entire application stack, and have some experience in most stages of the development cycle.I'm looking for a career where I can work on interesting problems and software, continue to feed my appetite for knowledge, and share that knowledge with those around me (and learn from them in the process!)Some of my favorite tools to work with are Node.js, React, and flux (and related tools like Redux). Recently I've been enjoying experimenting with Elixir, Clojure, and a few other languages. I am the author of NodeCasts, free screencasts for Node.js, Fluxxor, a library that implements the flux design pattern, and I wrote Understanding Dependency Injection for the AngularJS wiki.

She's done some fantastic work ad LinkedIn since I've met her, and in addition to that she helps others out, either in a charitable fashion, or in an advisory role. We have cross-consulted on potential start-up ideas, discussing obstacles and possibilities in great detail. A brilliant mind, a loyal person, and incredibly creative, anyone who has the chance to work with this young woman should take that opportunity. Lambert Chao Senior Technical Lead, Connectivity Group at Wolfram July 16, 2012, Lambert managed Kamilah directly Kamilah has both the technical skills and the intangible qualities that make her an invaluable asset for any team. During her time on the development team I led, I not only came to rely on her development expertise, but most valued her innate ability to understand the big picture, identify core issues, and present alternate viewpoints with clarity and moxy. Her personality made her a pleasure to work with. I look forward to watching her career grow as she realizes her full potential. Kristen Chan Principal Designer at NerdWallet April 8, 2015, Kristen worked with Kamilah in the same group I've known Kristen for most of the three years I've worked so far at LinkedIn. In that time, the two things that have always stood out to me is how happy she always seems, and how much she cares about the user's experience. I saw her do really cool work with visualizations, watched her iterate and bring the new mobile profile (blue steel) to a home run, and I always saw how much everyone on the team loved working with her, both developers and product. Kristen even contributes to the data viz community in the Bay Area by organizing a meetup, http://www.meetup.com/visualizemydata/. She spearheaded this meetup and is passionate about it. She spends extra time outside of work perfecting her craft.When we finally got placed on the same project and team, I was not just excited about working with Kristen, but with what she brings to a project. Kristen has such a strong background with visualizations, and good intuition both on what makes a good visualization and what a good experience is on mobile, that it's been really great working with her. She never stops looking at ways to improve the UX, seeks feedback from everyone on the team, and includes me in conversations about different directions she’s experimenting with - always with a smile! Any team and company would be lucky to have her. Staci Nicole Freeman, PHR,SHRM-CP Assistant Director/HR Business Partner, Financial Services @ EY June 1, 2011, Staci Nicole was senior to Kamilah but didn’t manage directly Staci is one of the best recruiters I've worked with. Since she has started recruiting for Wolfram they've been a significantly bigger presence at campus recruiting events. We met at a campus event where I actually wasn't initially aware that there would even be a possible match for me at the company, but Staci discovered a unique project that would be perfect for me and kept in touch with me until I applied for the position. Her technical background helps her identify good project/candidate matches, and her enthusiasm helps her attract and retain candidates. She was a huge part in recruiting me not only for an internship, but to stay on as a full time employee. Now as a full time employee, on the other side, I've seen that she has a definite talent for recruiting good smart people.

Not only did Carolyn complete our difficult, immersive bootcamp, but she graduated near the top of her class. So we invited her to become a teaching fellow, and join our engineering time.As a fellow, Carolyn once again distinguished herself. She dove right into our complex code base (for a learning management platform), and made meaningful contributions to our product on both the front and back end. She was a strong member of our agile team...good at estimating story points, and reliably completing all her tickets before the end of each sprint.Her code is, in a word, outstanding. She usually breezed right through code review, as her tickets got pushed into production.Carolyn is generally a disciplined, driven person. For example, she is a long distance runner (including running the NYC Marathon while she was on our team). This work ethic carries through to her career...she works hard, efficiently and effectively. If she says she's going to do something, it's as good as done.She also has a warm, friendly personality, that was a great cultural fit on our dev team. She got along well with her peer engineers, and managers...and was often willing/able to mentor less experienced engineers.Carolyn has a bright career ahead of her as a full stack engineer. If you have a chance to hire her...do it! hasn’t given any recommendations yet.

View 4 more recommendations View 4 more recommendations recommendations Martin Gallagher Experienced Recruiter specialising in Golang April 6, 2016, Ivan was a client of Martin’s Martin understood, after our first call, what kind of job position I was willing to find and just offered me a few positions, all of them matching my team culture, technology, working life and economical expectations.He understood that my first choice was to follow working remotely and with Golang which was of my top preferences. Because he understands the technical specifications of the companies and candidates, unlike many other recruiters, I found I didn't have to explain to him the subtleties of which jobs would be right for me. He clearly understood this - which was refreshing!.Due to his specialization in Golang, he introduced me, only after two weeks, one of his clients, who was looking for Golang Software Engineers to work with a distributed team, hence we had a match straight away. I think that he's a very good professional who understand both sides of the job market.

Not only that, Bill not only exceeds myself in dealing with customer support he also exceeds in documentation which is a major part of the full life cycle of development. Yet another asset of Bill is he is very easy to work with, which in turn he works well in team environments. In conclusion Bill has been around the block and would be the person who knows answers for foresees issues even before the occur, and can explain to a typical end user as well as a high end technical developer in their language. Bill is by far my pick as a team member if it was my choice. Ted Tregurtha President at Moran Towing December 10, 2009, Ted was senior to Michael but didn’t manage directly Ted actually hired me, so even at the start of my recommendation he is already a genius! all joking aside, Ted is a great boss/manager/CEO.

Globetrotting LION 9200+ December 26, 2013, Hari worked with Todd in different groups Todd is a top engineer and heavy hitter in the Hadoop ecosystem. Globally renowned amongst Clouderans for his technical skills and contributions he is one of just a couple of developers in the world that immediately springs to mind amongst Clouderans when they need help. Todd is without a doubt one of the handful of guys that makes Cloudera special. Lucas Hrabovsky special projects at MongoDB September 28, 2009, Lucas managed Todd directly Todd is an engineering savant. During his time at Amie Street, his skills were absolutely essential to addressing scaling issues and fixing whatever problems came up, no matter how large or small. Todd is always finding new technologies to optimize or make processes easier. His contributions to the open source community have been vast and varied, from Hadoop to Thrift to jQuery hacks. I really enjoyed getting to work with Todd and definitely hope our paths cross again in the future. Andrew Wong Software Engineer at Cloudera September 11, 2016, Todd was senior to Andrew but didn’t manage directly I was the technical lead on Andrew's team during his internship at Cloudera and directly reviewed most of his code. Andrew ramped up quickly on our large and complex C++ codebase, displayed a strong work ethic, and ultimately contributed some substantial performance improvements to the Apache Kudu open source project. He responded well to review feedback, motivated his proposed optimizations with good results on a prototype, and worked well with full-time team members over the summer.I would look forward to working with Andrew again, and can recommend him as a solid systems programmer. Aaron Myers Software Engineer at Cloudera April 23, 2010, Aaron worked with Todd in the same group I've worked with Aaron at both Brown University and Amie Street, and would be thrilled to work with him again.

Even with Google’s caliber of engineers, Vlad is one of the best people I’ve had the pleasure of working with.Vlad is highly competent on the technical front. At Google, he worked on two highly complex systems: an ambitious project to re-wire the inner workings of the search engine’s real-time query serving system and the Bigtable storage system. Vlad’s ability to take theoretical knowledge from his PhD and apply it in practice is exceptional. He was frequently the go-to person for debugging esoteric bugs whose origin no one could figure out. On numerous occasions, he would look at decompiled machine code and successfully debug crashes where no core dumps were available. Unlike others at his technical caliber, for whom solving technical problems is everything, Vlad brings a mature perspective to his role. He has a strong bias for getting things done while doing the right thing for the company. When he realized that one of his optimization projects just wouldn’t work, he pushed strongly to abandon the project rather than finish it haphazardly to save face.Finally, Vlad is a consummate team player and it is great to be around him. I’d hire him onto my team any day.

Yinsong first worked for me in his Capstone Project at Oregon State University. I was so impressed with Yinsong's abilities that after the school year ended, I asked him to take the project to the next level and gave him far more control over the project. I believed that with more control over the technical decisions in the project, Yinsong would be able to take my ideas for the project and implement them in a modern way. I am not disappointed! Yinsong was able to take my initial vision of the project and run with it to apply modern technologies and design. I've been constantly amazed at Yinsong's work ethic and diligence for the project.I wish I was in a position at my company to hire him, because I honestly believe he'd be an incredible asset to any team he's a part of.

University of Phoenix Sacramento, California Area 15 15 connections Connect Pending Invitation Sent Business:Through my studies for an MBA (2009-2010) which I enjoyed, I developed additional management skills. I discovered how much I liked the subjects of: Finance, Accounting, Economics, Statistics and Operations Management. Technology:As a software engineer, I have strong experience over the years on Intel based platforms and other architectures (Motorola, ARM). In the recent past with DSI, I've performed the role of an independent software contractor for companies such as Northrop-Grumman. I returned to school full-time (2009-2010) to earn an MBA. From 2000-2008, I worked at Intel as a Sr. Software Technical Marketing Engineer. Prior to this, I spent several years as a software developer for various companies in Orange County, CA. While at Intel, the primary function was to assist embedded software design teams with the use of the development tools, code development and debug for the Intel Network and Core processors.

Aude is dedicated, focused on the task at hand and a hard worker. I had the opportunity to see her exceptional problem-solving skills and collaboration spirit while writing a paper together. Aude can not only build a complex model to process your data, but she can also deliver quality code (python in this case) in a timely manner that actually works as expected! Her contribution was invaluable for this project with tight deadlines and a lot of uncertainty.Aude is an excellent presenter. In the dozen hour-long research meetings we had, Aude's oral presentations were always sharp, very polished and delivered in an effortless and natural manner.There is a lot of exceptional students at Berkeley. Even in this rarefied atmosphere, Aude stands out as one of the best coworkers I ever worked with. Samy Merzgui Business Marketing Strategy Manager at Adobe June 1, 2011, Timothy managed Samy directly Samy ported a large codebase to a different cloud computing enviroment (NERSC). This involved reimplementing part of a java pipeline, and solving build and deployment issues along with the systems team. The work was succeessfully accomplished in a timely fashion and led, amongst other things, to the publication of a paper.

February 21, 2015, Sean worked with Maureen in different groups I have known Maureen Sullivan for five years, while she was Executive Assistant and Office Manager for Basho's office in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Maureen organized countless in-person events for the team, meticulously managing all the important details even from halfway across the continent. She planned, renegotiated and canceled difficult travel arrangements for me on multiple occasions. If there was ever a difficult discussion to be had with a third party, Maureen was always willing to handle it on our behalf. She not only did amazing work, but made it her mission to know everyone well, welcome new employees, and anticipate everyone's needs. Maureen always went above and beyond the call of duty for me and my coworkers.Any organization that needs a confident, loyal, hard-working administrative assistant would be lucky to have Maureen.

The experience of working with him was only topped by the subsequent experience of working for him: albeit new to being in a management position at that time, he truly was one of the most dedicated, focussed and positively challenging managers I have seen in my 14-year career in Software Development. Jeremiah Dunham Software Development Manager at Elemental Technologies - I'm hiring! June 2, 2008, Jeremiah managed Seth directly Seth is an excellent software developer. He has the skill, curiosity, and creativity to solve virtually any problem that presents itself. He has a tremendous work ethic and is relentless in his efforts to work smarter. He exercises sound judgment on where to invest his time, especially when considering whether to implement a one-off solution or write something reusable. I would love to work with him again. Tim Schmelmer Sr. Software Engineer at Uber October 14, 2011, Seth managed Tim directly I had the pleasure of working with Tim twice in my career as a peer and as his manager. I will speak to my time managing Tim.Tim demonstrated a consistent ability to deliver results, making sound technical decisions in the face of pressing deadlines. What especially stands in my work with Tim, though, is his ability to deliver in the face of extreme ambiguity. Not only does Tim have the maturity to seek clarity in requirements, but he also has a sense of ownership and will push back when he sees a better way for the business. However, once heard Tim commit to the business's decision.Tim's positive attitude in the face of ambiguity and his ability to deliver earned him the respect of his peers. I was always able to delegate to Tim, both in terms of development work, but also varied leadership tasks, as I know he's able to execute and represent the team well.I would hire Tim again without question. Jeremiah Dunham Software Development Manager at Elemental Technologies - I'm hiring! December 3, 2007, Seth reported directly to Jeremiah Jeremiah is a very effective manager. His understanding of technology is that of a talented software developer, yet he is able to effectively delegate and organize his team without micromanaging. Jeremiah was able to provide me with the guidance and direction I needed to complete my day to day tasks while at the same time planning and revising the long term strategy for our group.

In my dissertation,which expands considerably on my M.S. thesis, I provide the theoretical machinery to work with these types and implementation approaches to make their implementation feasible. Of particular interest is the fact that type checking is undecidable, so I introduce many new techniques for reasoning about and implementing undecidable type systems.I show how to enforce an undecidable type system by blending static and dynamic checking in a technique dubbed "Hybrid Type Checking". Then I show that one may still omit all type annotations and the compiler can fill them in with the strongest candidate types possible.

March 25, 2012, Aaron worked with Kenneth in the same group Aaron has an eye for elegance in theory and practice, and always keeps his skill in abstract work well-grounded in real problems. Our research work together on Hybrid Type Checking included innovating at the frontier of type theory, implementing those ideas in a prototype language, and further implementing programs in our new language to empirically validate the usefulness of the type system. Aaron was integral to all three aspects. After our project concluded, Aaron went even further in developing the end-to-end connection of new ideas in programming languages to the practice of making reliable software, as you can see both by a perusal of his research work as well as his career outside of academia. Aaron is top notch; I would leap at the chance to work with him again, whether on original research or just creating great software.

October 6, 2011, Will worked with Olivier but at different companies It's not often a supplier gives their client a recommendation, but in the case of fast-turnaround design work, Olivier was a standout client.Olivier gave us the perfect combination of critical feedback and direction with real creative freedom on design, asked very good questions, made his input meaningful and useful.Oh, his app is freakin cool too. Mike Gibbs President, SureStep Risk Management May 16, 2007, Mike was senior to Olivier but didn’t manage directly Hands down, the best developer I have ever worked with. Olivier has a 'can do' attitude regardless of the deadlines or challenges a project may face and has the technical chops to back it up. His positive nature comes through when the pressure is highest and he is a calming influence at those times. I would very much enjoy an opportunity to work with Olivier again at some point in the future and heartily endorse him as both developer and person. Will Dayble Social impact education stuff. October 6, 2011, Olivier was a client of Will’s Its a pleasure working with Will and Squareweave.Will has a formula for producing great work: he will understand your needs, spin it around and make you articulate them better. Then he will meticulously, relentlessly and rapidly execute on this knowledge.They are great people and make stunning designs. Mike Gibbs President, SureStep Risk Management May 15, 2007, Olivier worked with Mike in different groups I have worked with Mike for a year and all the while we were working together, his excellent sales skills really shined through. With his humor, enthusiasm, persuasiveness and integrity, he develops strong relationships with his customers. Mike is particularly skilled at communicating clearly and effectively, a skill extremely valuable when dealing with an international portfolio of clients as he was. I do no hesitate to recommend Mike as he will be an asset in any organization he may join.

He is very strong in computer science, mathematics and biology, and I had the fortune to learn a lot from him. I can identify at least the following three areas of strength: 1) He is always looking for new challenges, difficult questions, and possible explanations to phenomena around him; 2) He is very capable at developing very quickly prototypes and tools to solve problems and answer questions; 3) He is an amazing communicator, able to explain complex with arbitrary complexity to an heterogeneous audience. Joemmanuel Ponce Galindo Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft. Co-founder & VP at omegaUp.org December 21, 2010, Joemmanuel was a client of Edgar’s I had the opportunity to interact with Edgar in two different contexts. Firstly Edgar was one of my trainers in the Guanajuato State Olympiad in Informatics 2004 (OIEG). His work as professor was outstanding. He is very patient and has an impressive synthesis skill that was very helpful in trying to understand complex problems. Also he supplemented his lessons with super-interesting practical material related with topics we were learning. Furthermore he always tried to add value to the entire training course by developing interesting game interfaces AIs to play with.3 years later I had the opportunity to work again with Edgar. I invited him to the the reviewers and problemsetters team of the Open National Programming Contest (ANPA). His detail-oriented work was a key fact of the contest's success. His tasks were always ranked among the most difficult and most interesting by ANPA contestants. Also his tasks reviews reflected his creativity with inventive texts.Finally I can affirm that Edgar is one of the most intelligent and results-oriented individuals I have met. He is always thinking in methods to improve on his work and that's a very valuable skill everywhere.

Suzanne Sadedin Evolutionary biologist and writer January 19, 2015, Suzanne worked with Edgar in the same group Suzanne is extremely sharp and knowledgeable in a wide range of fields. She is positioned perfectly to interface between biologists and computer scientists as has in-depth expertise in both.She is an extraordinarily insightful evolutionary biologist and ecologist who can understand the underlying forces shaping a phenomenon faster than just about anyone. Her intuition on how biological systems behave allows her to quickly discard ideas that will not work, and develop the ones that will.She is also an accomplished programmer. She can take a very complex idea from conception to a working implementation very quickly. Her implementations are tailored for large scale computation and are very well optimized.Finally, Suzanne has an innate talent for expressing complex ideas in very clear and simple words. She can communicate scientific findings in an engaging way through captivating writing that will leave you wanting to learn more.

Even though he is almost 15 years younger than me he holds a lot of wisdom and maturity in tough situations. It's been an honor to work with him and I hope to continue to work with him in future. Jerry Cheng Head of Mobile Development at Atlassian September 30, 2012, Jerry managed Naveen directly I had the pleasure of working with Naveen in Yahoo's Mobile Search Application development team. Naveen was a one the best bright young talents that I have ever came across. He was self motivated, driven, innovative and cares a lot about user experience. A total packageNaveen was first recruited into the group by our SVP for his hack day victory with a very innovative image recognition app that he built. Despite various challenges he faced in trying to create a new app in a big company, he was not discouraged and kept on pushing. He wore multiple hats due to the lack of resources and he was the PM of his app, the UED of his app and the developer of his app. His desire to succeed allow him to overcome many obstacles and really sets the tone for the other members of the team that worked on different project, despite being one of the most junior members of the team.Outside of work, Naveen is social and easy to get along with. I had a really great time working with Naveen and I believe he will have a very bright future as one of the best mobile engineer. I think any company would be lucky to have Naveen.

Maybe. Move along. Nothing to see here... Aaron Newton Head of Product at Thanx Inc June 1, 2011, Aaron worked with Aaron in the same group Working next to Aaron (that's ATM to those who know him) requires constant vigilance. Sure, he's a bad ass developer who has the work stamina of a pack of mules, but all that takes a back seat when you consider his razor sharp wit. No, you can't softball things over the plate with ATM and not expect him to drive it out of the park. Even a curve ball rarely gets by him. Simply put, working next to ATM means that you have to bring your A game not only in your own work to live up to his shining example of productivity and elegant code, you have to do it while sparring with him mentally. He keeps you sharp, on your toes. As much as this "recommendation" is a warning, I'd welcome the opportunity to work with him again if for no other reason than it would keep me in shape.

His first product plan was to "forget 'big data,' we're making a Reddit for Airlines!" After about a week of planning and scoping sessions with the engineering team, however, Charles decided to stick with Hadoop. I think the market has borne this decision out. Dan Kuebrich product, engineering August 30, 2010, Dan worked with Aaron in the same group I both attended college with Dan and worked with him for almost two years at Amie Street.Working with Dan was consistently a joy. I, personally, have never worked with anyone as well as I have worked with Dan. Not only is the work he produces outstanding, but he makes everyone around him better. He is patient and deferential when appropriate, and properly forceful when convinced of his side of a debate. Dan is extremely articulate, and a fantastic communicator. There are few people I would rather engage in technical discussion with, or receive technical communication from.As long as I have known him, Dan has always maintained an admirable work/life balance. His impact on the people around him is not only positive professionally, but culturally as well.I honestly hope to have the pleasure of working with him again one day. I recommend him extremely highly.

I only managed him for a few months before he moved on to another engineering group to solve different kinds of problems -- a pattern he repeated a few times at Upromise, with great success -- but in all the time we worked together I can't recall anyone else having quite the same energy, creativity, and passion for problem-solving as Joe. Whether it was sharing brain-teasers at lunch, delving into architectural whiteboard sessions, or emailing about the right way to refactor some tricky client-side code, Joe would always bring his characteristic curiosity and formidable intellect to bear on the problem at hand. Joe was the one who first (with great excitement) told me about using JavaScript to make asynchronous HTTP requests, some two years before anyone called it "Ajax"... and he also encouraged me to learn about this beautiful and powerful new programming language called "Ruby" and its emerging web application framework called "Rails", again nearly two years before the rest of the industry caught on to the power of this technology. When Joe has something to say, it behooves anyone in earshot to pay careful attention. He's brilliant, ethical, effective, energetic and just a great person to have on your team. Obviously I'd work with him again in a heartbeat, and recommend him highly and without reservation.

As part of the relatively small tools and productivity team at Jet, Nora had not only stepped up to take the lead on development of the tools but had also been instrumental in evangelizing and gaining traction on the tooling with all the technology teams at Jet. Her technical creativity, ability to form relationships and communicate product vision to others is extremely valuable in delivering an idea from inception to adoption. She also takes an active interest in helping her colleagues cultivate their professional goals such as learning new technologies or participating in conferences, having gained a lot of experience herself on that front. Nora is an asset to any team and I would love to work with her again! Rahul Ratnagiri Software Engineer at Jet.com March 19, 2017, Rahul reported directly to Nora "I would like to recommend Nora, because she is one of the most complete engineers I have worked with. Nora is a highly skilled software developer, while also an excellent delegate for cross-team negotiations. She is highly motivated, smart, and very talented. When I joined Jet's internal tools and productivity team under Nora's supervision, her roles ranged from handling multiple development projects, to meeting with third party software companies for deciding the best productivity and testing tools to use internally, and to evangelize our tools to developer teams. I have seen her handle all the different roles effectively, while also taking up initiatives like chaos testing, and "Purple Friday Games" (gamifying developer teams' preparation for Purple Friday). Nora has a true knack for mentorship. Her style of guiding, rather than instructing, encouraged me to think and work independently. Shadowing her into meetings and discussing the outcomes with her later, I gathered a lot of domain knowledge. I also enjoyed code and design reviews with Nora for her ideas, opinions, and questions.

Cody was the designated "expert" on countless topics, and if he wasn't the expert - he was likely about to be pulled into the project to give his opinion. While he was a fantastic engineer, he was also a wonderful colleague on a personal level; always willing to help train someone new or give advice on a subject. I found Cody to be a great mentor to me when I started at the company, and he was easily someone I would solicit for technical advice throughout my tenure - whether it was hearing out an idea or poking holes in an architecture, Cody could advise on it within no time at all. My favorite project was when Cody and I got to partner on an effort that would drive the availability of the Jet platform up across all teams.

As it usually happens, that's not due to any professional ability one might well learn by books (which he by no means lack), but rather, due to personal traits that are very hard to find.He's been very supportive in 100 % of the situations, and greatly worried about the progress of everyone around. Definitely someone I'd like to keep working with for many years to come. Eduardo Oliveira Associate at McKinsey & Company June 9, 2008, Eduardo worked with Glauber in the same group Me and Eduardo worked together at the university's jr. company. And he always showed a large set of personal skills. Schedule a meeting, and he'll be there. No matter what, no matter how (in time). Need a rush? Count on him.

He's easy to work with, organized and communicates clearly and openly. We worked through many difficult problems thanks to his ability to break things down and map them out visually on the whiteboard. If I were to start a company tomorrow, Bill would be the first person I would hire. He has the technical expertise to lead a team of developers and the people skills to effectively interface with other programmers, teams and clients. Niles Plante Product Management Professional February 5, 2010, William worked with Niles in the same group William and I worked on the product team for Rupture.com. Immediately after the Rupture acquisition by EA, we worked on similar products building a road-map for integrating them into a single product. Later, we worked on the converged product with William focusing on the product experience for the Web and my team in LA working on the PC application. Throughout the development of the product, William was able to blend his passion for games with his vision for a the product in a way that showed through in the quality of his work. His background in engineering was a major plus as well making him an immeasurably valuable member of the team and I have no doubt that he will bring the same value to any company luck enough to have him join them.

I've directly managed Eric for a couple years now and I can always trust that he's working very hard on whatever project we're tackling. As a busy manager who is pulled in several directions, Eric's self-motivation, dedication and ability to unblock himself has allowed us to make huge progress on a project that would otherwise be advancing much more slowly.I can't recommend Eric enough. I would hire Eric anytime for any role he was passionate about. He has become a very competent programmer, learning new technologies very rapidly, and a good friend. Jacob Vorreuter Engineering Manager at Heroku November 16, 2010, William managed Jacob directly I was one of the first employees at Rupture, over the course of 4 years I worked on or led every team. The most challenging, fun, sometimes aggravating (in a good way!) projects I tackled were with Jacob as a part of the Platform team.When I first joined that team I was overwhelmed by the technology that had been built. Jacob built a code base that handled a fire hose of incoming data from internal sources at Electronic Arts, pulled data from external sites like Microsoft's xbox.com, and processed it all for use at Rupture.Jacob is an Erlang expert, and he quickly brought me up to speed with the language and software built in Erlang. Together he helped turn our feature roadmap into real code. I strongly recommend Jacob, and will always seek him out for future projects or opportunities.

This team builds full-stack infrastructure used by product engineers, including backend services built in Go, client frameworks and infrastructure, advises on system design, and introduces other tooling (e.g. Flow types, request tracing, build systems) to help the entire engineering team move more quickly, as we rapidly scale in number of users and size of data. Our primary focuses are site performance, productivity, and cost.In addition to my technical work, I (along with a few colleagues) hold a Diversity Advocate role within the engineering team.

She's never afraid to ask the tough questions regarding a project, and more often than not the outcome is for the better. She's intelligent, approachable, and seemingly never tires of learning to the benefit of her craft and approach to building better products. She is precisely the type of person you want on your team, and I hope we get the chance to work together again in the future. Bruno Furnari VP Product @ Nielsen April 19, 2010, Bruno worked with Kelly in different groups Kelly's relentless attention to detail not only reflects on the quality of her code, but forces everyone around her to be at the top of their game. She is extremely smart, a great team player and genuinely passionate about what she is working on -- from the nuts and bolts to how the final product is going to be used.

At Current, Mario was a total superstar, working and communicating equally well with both executives and software engineers.

The extensive experience he brought to Current was another strength - he's brought many products to market at a number of companies and understands the industry inside and out. Mario would be a great asset to any team. Derk Pippin Quality Assurance Engineer at Chariot March 6, 2012, Derk worked with Kelly in the same group Derk's primary asset, is definitely his infectious enthusiasm and the excitement he brought to the team and everyone who worked with him. It's impossible not to smile when Derk's around! He's one of the most passionate team players I've ever worked with.

He was totally unflappable on the first project I ever worked with him. He did a great job of pushing the project through to completion despite its being a very ambitious project mostly staffed by relatively inexperienced engineers. Add to that his considerable design and implementation prowess and you have a great engineer. Luke Hornof Director, Nervana System Software January 23, 2012, Luke worked with Mike in the same group Luke is diligent and hard-working. He took on a refactoring job in code that got written in a hurry, and did quite well taking design suggestions from his manager as well as other members of staff who had varying opinions on what needed doing. In addition, I'm fairly jealous of his unflappability - we had a member of staff who was universally difficult in interpersonal situations. Luke caught this fellow on a bad day and got snapped at pretty viciously. I'd have called him out and made a bad situation worse, but Luke handled the situation both politely and calmly.

Both were implemented in C# and required knowledge of ASP.NET MVC, database programming, some network programming and careful thought because of the project's scale and reliability requirements.Both of these tasks were a challenge, and Sergey handled them professionally and with huge enthusiasm. He also showed an impressive ability to rapidly absorb and apply new ideas and techniques (Sergey started the project as a junior engineer but quickly progressed).

October 17, 2012, Lev worked with Eugene in the same group Lev founded the journal and gathered the first set of authors. He did an unhuman amount of work on creating an environment for the authors to work in - unique LaTeX classes and design, facilities to publish to web as well as print, the journal's website, collaboration with typographers, attracting authors and reviewers and reviewing articles for the first few issues, etc. etc.Then another editor-in-chief took over for a few next issues, and then I did.I strongly believe that the result - a journal with world-class quality and no analogues in Russia or actually in the world - had a substantial impact on Russia's programming industry as a whole.

Over the years, I have worked at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, built to massive scale, run large teams, founded and run my own startups, and advised several other startups, some of which were acquired. I invented the now widely used item-to-item collaborative filtering algorithm, contributed to many patents and academic publications, and have been quoted often in books and in the press.

More information about the book on the publisher's site: (https://lnkd.in/ekreCCt) The book is aimed at the Data Scientist / Engineer starting out with Neural Networks. It contains a mix of theory and examples, but the focus is on the code, since in our experience, that is the best way to learn about a new field. All examples are in Keras, our favorite DL toolkit. By the time you finish the book, you should be comfortable building networks to solve your own problems. I can't thank my co-author Antonio Gulli enough for asking me to co-author the book with him, and the great folks at PackT (Divya Poojari, Cheryl Dsa, Dinesh Pawar) who worked with us all the way to bring this book to market. This has been an amazing experience for me, thanks to everyone for making it happen. The book is available on Amazon for purchase (https://lnkd.in/eeDeeWf). Appreciate reviews.

During onboarding, she sent me a list of companies she thought would be a good match and provided a great level of detail about each one. She was extremely respectful of my time and only connected me with companies she honestly felt would be a great fit. After I expressed interest in a few companies (it was hard to decide between all the great ones she works with), Jovena took all of the stress out of setting up and preparing for interviews. Whether I was going into an initial phone screen or a final round technical interview, she provided thorough and customized notes about what to expect and how to prepare.I accepted an amazing offer this week and couldn't be happier. Looking back, Jovena's role in the whole process felt much closer to "coach" than "recruiter." I can't recommend her enough!

If you are looking for a developer to blindly do what he is asked whether he thinks that's right or not, then Nics not for you, if however you want someone to actively participate and provide valuable feedback & ideas then I can't recommend Nic highly enough. Hugo Rodger-Brown Co-Founder, Product + Tech, YunoJuno June 30, 2011, Hugo was a client of Nicolas’ Nicolas is a way more than a front-end developer, although his understanding of HTML alone makes him worth hiring. He really 'gets' the internet, and how it works; a great person to bounce ideas off, and a pleasure to work with. You could also just check out his blog if you wanted any more evidence.. View 1 more recommendation View 1 more recommendation recommendations Gareth Thackeray Full stack .net engineer June 19, 2011, Gareth was senior to Nicolas but didn’t manage directly Working with Gaz was a real pleasure. He's incredibly enthusiastic and knowledgable about the technologies he works with, is always looking to learn and use appropriate new tools or approaches, and is a great communicator. It doesn't hurt that he's also comfortable with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and aware of the concerns of front-end developers.Looking beyond his technical abilities, Gaz helped to integrate me into the team and was always patient in guiding me through the codebase and any troubles I encountered. He really cares about the projects he is working on and would regularly contribute to UX discussions, communicate with the client, and help shape the project for the better. As such, Gaz is not just a fantastic technical contributor, but a valuable link between all disciplines. Greg Machray Project Director at The Engine Group January 21, 2010, Nicolas reported directly to Greg Greg is hard-working, has excellent technical knowledge of web development, a keen eye for detail, and an amiable personality that makes him ideally suited to managing clients and team members on web projects. You cannot overstate the value of technical experience in project managers dealing with web products and Greg always actively contributed to the overall quality of projects and the confidence of the client. It was also a lot of fun working with Greg...although his taste in music is questionable!

There's something about him that makes each day less stressful and more approachable, even when the team is faced with a world of work. This is one of many reasons why I was happy to work with Nick in projects outside of the office.In terms of technical ability I have seen Nick work exclusively with a design team on a style guide for 30+ engineers, CSS+LESS for the application, and HTML+React markup to fit-and-finish feature work. On the day I write this he went beyond to ask people about how to improve the process not just for his team, but the rest of the company. Nick has a way of always fitting in, appreciating the people around him, and finding new ways to connect. I'm proud to call him a friend as well as a colleague, and I am hard pressed to think of a company that truly deserves someone like him. Ahmad Aslami CTO at Understory October 21, 2016, Sage reported directly to Ahmad Ahmad is easily one of the most calm, level-headed, and aware managers I've had the pleasure of reporting to. While it's clear he is always busy, he still makes time to answer many questions about our direction and how to balance engineering and sales interests. I see him as both a mentor and a friend, and would hope to work with him in the future even after our time at Promethean.

Having known her for over a year now, I can say she's incredibly motivated, curious, and creative. Her past experience as a writer transfers well to software engineering in that she's a solid communicator with a sharp eye for bugs. Wendy was usually one of the first people I asked for code reviews or pairing sessions because her detail-oriented nature meant that she spotted any errors quickly. At the same time, she constantly seeks to understand the big picture of any codebase to which she contributes. If given the opportunity to work with Wendy again, I'd take it in an instant!

By the time I finished middle school, I was gleaming with pride on how I could make the entire background bright baby blue of my one page HTML website, and by the time I finished college, I was proud that I was able to create a mobile product from the ground up for a startup company, significantly cut down on-boarding times for new employees through new software, and even create the basic workings of a voice-recognition bot.Now, I’m a Software Engineer for Indus Valley Partners, and I’m working with teams to improve their data-management product line on a daily basis. I’ve been able to quickly dive into expansive code-bases and optimize speeds by over 90% on processes and create genericized modules to be used for a variety of data extraction scenarios. Even though IVP is mainly a .Net and MSSQL based company, I’m still learning about technologies such as Python, MySql/MariaDB, Distributed Systems, and others through constantly learning about new avenues for improvement for the current processes. Both inside and outside of work, I’m always pushing myself to keep learning.

At Quantcast, he led the technical effort to overhaul our build and package management system. He was able to deeply understand what we needed to produce reliable software components, design a solution and implement it cleanly and in a short amount of time. Perhaps more importantly, he was able to garner support for and clearly communicate the benefits of this radical change in software development process and project structure. Furthermore, his ability to learn (and become proficient in) new technologies and languages such as Scala in record time was astounding.

Graham Wheeler Director of Engineering (Shipping Science) at eBay. I am hiring experienced Applied ML Data Scientists. April 1, 2007, Graham reported directly to John John was one of my first managers at Microsoft and ranks among the best (and I've had plenty). He combines a razor sharp intellect, excellent team skills, a getting things done approach, with humility and deep integrity, and a genuine concern for the welfare and development of his reports. He is simply a wonderful guy to work for. View 1 more recommendation View 1 more recommendation recommendations Mitch Goldberg Director of Development February 26, 2017, John reported directly to Mitch Mitch is one of the best managers I've ever had. I worked for six years at Microsoft Research Cambridge, when he was charged with initiating and coordinating productization of research results. He created a general-purpose incubation team, staffed it, and created an environment where people could truly innovate and take risks.Many of those risks paid off, and his efforts on this team directly contributed to Microsoft shipping the Touch mouse, AutoCollage, and many other commercially successful products. His unique approach ensured relevant and valuable results without unnecessary process or pigeonholing.The best things about working for Mitch include: his mentorship and guidance, successfully creating and protecting a fertile work environment; his coming up with big ideas and connecting people across divisions and companies to make them happen; passion for technology, innovations, and devices; and his ability to demand the best from everyone in a positive way.To put things in perspective, I've had perhaps 20 managers over the years, often leaving because I get bored or don't enjoy the environment. I worked for Mitch for almost a third of my career, and would happily work with or for him again. He's a great manager and a fantastic technologist. Alex Mallet Senior Manager, Consumer Localization June 11, 2015, John reported directly to Alex I worked for Alex on the Peer Networking team for Windows XP (2001-3), and have stayed in touch with him since. Alex is impressive in many dimensions: technically strong, solid communication skills, good instincts for potential landmines ahead, and good cross-group coordination. He's also a decent guy, and fun to work with. Alex is one of the few people who hearing he was at a company and hiring would automatically make me consider joining that company. In my experience with Alex, he's especially good at computer networking and distributed systems. He's extremely intelligent and able to come up to speed in pretty much any area.In short, Alex is a strong technical manager with good technical chops.

My name is Athena. I'm currently a software engineer at Amazon Vancouver. Working at Amazon means a lot of new and exciting things happening every day. Of course, that doesn't come without a lot of hard work, but it's given me a chance to learn from the best and brightest. It has also taught me what it means to "put the customers first". I graduated from UBC with a Bsc. in Computer Science. What had inspired me to study computer science was a Pixar talk I attended as a high schooler. I was amazed at what could be accomplished with computer graphics and the way that Pixar uses new technology to tell a story perhaps much better than anyone ever could. At university, I joined the UBC Imager Graphics Lab and became part of many computer graphics related research projects. One of my fondest memories was attending SIGGRAPH 2013 in Anaheim :)When I'm not coding, I like to design and sew my own clothes. Making things with my hands is very therapeutic to me and has always been my passion. I recently picked up a pattern drafting course on Craftsy and am super excited to start making clothes that fit true to my size. I also enjoy organizing and reorganizing my apartment :) See moreSee more of undefined summary Highlights Follow Follow {:entityName} Athena’s Activity 244 followers Vancouver (Downtown): National Girls Learning Code Day Storytelling & Animation Athena liked So awesome!

Arindam Bhattacharya Product Management Mobile Ads at A9.com - Amazon December 25, 2006, Arindam reported directly to Jean-Baptiste I have been working with JBQ for the past 5 years and it has always been a pleasure working with him. He was the primary architect behind the new Openwave browser and he really gave a new direction to the product. His ability to both understand , solve and then explain to others complex technical problems has been helpful for the whole team. He did seamlessly transition into the new role as Engineering Manager and from the very first day was on top of all the required issues. He never allows external distractions to affect the team and is always guiding the team both as a manager and as an architect. It really amazes me at how he fits into both roles at ease. I look forward to working with JBQ in the future.

She gave a presentation on "Non-Relational Databases" at the San Francisco Perl Mongers group in September 2009, not an easy audience by any means! Kristina had done her prep work so well that it faded into the background: she covered a challenging topic in clear, direct language; was easy to hear and understand; paced the talk well; showed a real depth of understanding of her parts of the project; freely acknowledged the parts of the project that she was not expert in; and handled difficult questions gracefully (and often with ease.) More than that, though, she did an excellent job of placing her company's server in context, a step which many presenters give short shrift, and had even prepped some real, interesting issues with which to engage the group. Having met Kristina before and been impressed by her, it was nice to see her in action. hasn’t given any recommendations yet.

November 12, 2015, Ben reported directly to Janelle I had the great pleasure of having Janelle as my mentor during my internship at Snapchat. The other recommendations have already touched on her technical prowess, so I'll instead focus on how much she contributed to my internship experience. As this was my first foray into industry, I was slightly apprehensive of working and contributing to a real world product, but Janelle not only was extraordinarily helpful in teaching me code conventions and techniques, but also was incredibly welcoming and considerate. There were countless timeless times I had some bug or question, and she continually helped me quickly and thoughtfully. Her patience was endless and her answers went straight to the heart of the issue and consistently helped me resolve the problem. She was a great leader and a thoughtful teacher. Deborah van Dam Entrepreneurial Digital Communications and Marketing Manager June 5, 2013, Janelle worked with Deborah in the same group Janelle and I worked closely to build CrowdJewel (dba ShopBevel). Building a company requires enormous dedication, patience and tenacity, and though Janelle was challenged on a number of fronts, she was able to adapt and succeed. First, she had to take over an unfinished product and not only had to make it work but also make it attractive and intuitive. Janelle worked overtime while working on her M.S. to learn how to build out the site in time for pitching. Second, CrowdJewel was in a space that she is not familiar with (jewelry/fashion, ecommerce). Janelle immersed herself in this industry and was able to interact naturally with customers as needed. Third, she was challenged interpersonally. We had to work very quickly with a range of personalities, compounded with the stress of working non-stop. Janelle handled herself appropriately and professionally at all times, and maintained a sunny disposition that helped keep spirits up. As a result, Janelle's contributions were critical to our team's ability to successfully raise our first round of financing. She is a team player, an open communicator, and is always around to lend a hand. She's receptive to feedback and doesn't have an attitude. Hands down I would work with her again. View 1 more recommendation View 1 more recommendation recommendations Ben Ulmer Software Engineering Intern at Snapchat, Inc. November 13, 2015, Janelle managed Ben directly Snapchat's intern program is small and very competitive, and Ben snagged a spot despite this being his first industry internship. For extra challenges, he was:a) placed on the Messaging team, which arguably has one of the steepest learning curves of any team in the company,b) assigned as my mentee, andc) immediately asked to develop in an unfamiliar language/platform (Ben’s work was largely on iOS, and it’s worth noting that he's an Android user).Ben dove right into the codebase and quickly assimilated to the team, learning what it was to be a full-time Snapchat engineer. He was contributing meaningful work into our product releases and far exceeded my expectations for what he accomplished. Technical ability aside, he was also such a pleasure to work with. He’s a great communicator with an always-positive, can-do attitude.Though I’m biased and would love to have Ben back at Snapchat, whichever company he joins would be lucky to have him!

He is a valuable asset for the team. I would not hesitate to recommend Daniel for any position in storage software engineering. View 1 more recommendation View 1 more recommendation recommendations Emery Wang Software Engineer September 9, 2014, Emery worked with Daniel in the same group I worked directly with Emery for more than two years as a peer at Symantec.I believe there are two kinds of great coworkers: adders and multipliers. Adders do their own work well, but multipliers enable every other team member to do better work. Emery Wang is the textbook example of a multiplier. With him onboard, the entire team is able to work far more effectively. The best example of Emery's multiplier effect was on a challenging project in which engineers required high-end storage arrays and servers. There was never enough equipment for team members to get their development and test tasks done, leading to many weeks of frustrating wasted time. Emery took charge of the situation and organized the hardware into complete clusters that could be reserved on a per-task basis, arranged for nonfunctioning systems to get fixed and installed, and presented a successful case to upper management that purchasing more equipment would be necessary in order for the project to be successful. In the end, Emery was effectively managing more than $10 million of lab equipment in three countries all on top of his ordinary software development duties! Emery identified a problem, took the initiative, and fixed it, saving the other members of his team thousands of hours of wasted time. Emery was a key asset for Symantec as a whole, and I am proud to have worked with him. He would be a fantastic contributor and multiplier on any software development team.

He has the ability to instantly understand any problem that he's presented with, dig into the details and come up with an elegant and appropriate solution. Chris is also one of the best pairs I've ever worked with, having the ability to make anyone feel at ease -- even when pairing with a candidate in an interview. Travis Downs Principal Member of Technical Team at Salesforce.com March 11, 2010, Travis managed Christopher directly Chris is an exceptionally talented developer, and a pleasure both to work with and to manage. Chris can do pretty much anything - and with speed and accuracy.On a personal level, Chris is both friendly, approachable and easy going - all traits that made him an ideal addition to our team (for the all-too-short period we were able to keep him). Jenni Hantula Software Developer at Yardi April 22, 2017, Christopher was senior to Jenni but didn’t manage directly Jenni is an extremely quick learner and a joy to work with. She gets her work done efficiently and is fun to have in the office, with her love of board games and Finnish rock 'n roll. Over the 3 years we worked together, she took on projects in R, python, node.js, Ruby, and Java. It didn't matter the language or framework. She always ramped up quickly and produced high-quality code.She's able to tackle large, complicated problems with ease. I code reviewed a lot of the work she did on the 'prediction service' (a python service that used machine learning algorithms to predict energy usage). I was always impressed with her strong grasp of the underlying statistics and how well-organized her code was. Yushu Lin Software Engineer June 10, 2016, Christopher was senior to Yushu but didn’t manage directly Yushu's biggest strength is his ability to quickly learn new programming languages and understand existing code bases. At EnerNOC I code-reviewed a lot of his work, written in a variety of languages including Java, Ruby, and Python. It didn't matter if the language or frameworks he was asked to work with were familiar to him or not, he always wrote high quality code.I was also impressed with his eagerness to take on new projects without a manager having to tell him what to do. When he found performance bottlenecks, he improved them. When he saw an opportunity to enrich the office culture, he created fun side projects (like a Slack trivia bot).Yushu will make a fine addition to any software development team, and I'm interested to see where his career takes him.

As his manager, I always knew I could rely on him to solve complex technical problems, produce very high quality code and meet aggressive milestones. Passionate about his work, feeling tremendous responsibility about the code he "owned", he always worked tirelessly to achieve his goals. That was true whether he was writing code himself or was directing his group to implemement a project.Alex is an excellent code architect and programmer. He worked in diverse areas of Creo Simulate (Mechanica), a CAE product targeting Mechanical Engineers, including computational geometry, meshing, graphics and user interface. Although a computer scientist, Alex could easily grap engineering concepts and make major contributions across the application.When I think of Alex, the words that come to mind are dedication, attention to detail, long working hours. Alex will be great asset to any organization he joins. I would definitely love the opportunity to work with Alex again. Amit Bhandwale Software Architect October 1, 2013, Alexander was senior to Amit but didn’t manage directly Alex is a software engineer, software architect, QA engineer, team leader, product owner & project manager ... all rolled into one. Apart from his technical expertise, what struck me was his attention to detail, ability to multitask and passion for software processes & quality, no matter how trivial the task. Our 6 year association helped me in becoming a well-rounded software engineer and I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again. View 7 more recommendations View 7 more recommendations recommendations Tad Doxsee Founder at PlanIt9 October 28, 2013, Alexander reported directly to Tad Tad had been my direct manager for more than 15 years. We have worked together on many big and complex projects, which allowed me to observe Tad's managerial style in close proximity. One quality that impresses me the most is Tad's ability to mediate negotiations between disagreeing parties (I usually was one of them) and drive them to reach a consensus. Tad always keeps a bigger picture in mind and this allows him to look at the problem at hand from different perspectives, often resulting in original solutions. Tad is not only an exceptional manager but also a prolific developer. He can successfully juggle many activities at the same time, including team management, design, writing specifications, implementation, debugging, code review, and many others. When Tad got interested in functional programming (Haskell) he also convinced the entire team to attend his class in order to "expand the mind" (and it did - at least for me!) I would welcome an opportunity to work with Tad again. Steve Berkeley Sr Software Development Manager at Autodesk September 21, 2013, Steve worked with Alexander in the same group I worked with Steve for many years, and his personal and professional qualities never ceased to amaze me. Steve possesses a true talent for seeing a bigger picture in any project he is involved with. He has great interpersonal skills, which he successfully uses to build consensus among stakeholders. Steve knows very complicated Creo Simulate code in great depth, and is able to come up with a quality solution to almost any technical problem. Not only he was directly responsible for many aspects of software planning and development in Creo Simulate, he also built and maintained an excellent set of the build tools and automated testing tools used by entire development organization and QA.I would welcome an opportunity to work with Steve again in the future.

I've had the chance to work with him building the Reader app for Windows. He innovated on different fronts to ensure different aspects of the product were thoroughly tested and held a high bar for quality. He engineered systems for large scale analysis of errors and a robust mechanism to route them efficiently to engineers. He also delivered on interfaces for regular validation that engineers could use to pre-validate changes and reduce risk of regressions.

Just to give a hint; At LSF, we (about 6 people) worked on a project to completely re-design Apache’s Web Services engine (Axis) and one of the key challenges in this project was to provide an object model for the SOAP messages handled by the engine with streaming (StAX) friendly manner. We had an interesting discussion on what need to be done (not how it can be done) in one of the days. The next day, Ajith came bit late to work, but he had a working prototype of the object model in his laptop. This project later becomes a separate Apache project on its own named AXIOM. I highly recommend Ajith to any organization with tough technical challenges. Amila Navarathna Director at Deloitte Platform Engineering November 22, 2010, Amila worked with Jaliya in the same group I have known Amila for more than 10 years and have worked with him for several years as a student project member and also as a colleague in both Lanka Software Foundation and and in Virtusa corp.Amila is a passionate software engineer who never give up on engineering challenges. He always had a solution we could count on. His dedication and talent help our group to create Apache Sandesha project, which was the only open source implementation of WS-ReliableMessaging protocol at that time. I certainly would recommend Amila anytime.

Sharmila Jesupaul Software Engineer, Front End December 6, 2015, Hou worked with Sharmila in the same group Hou is a talented engineer and a wonderful teammate. He is very well rounded and has a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals as well as a variety of frameworks and languages. He is careful to avoid common anti-patterns and always pays attention to details. During his first few weeks at Tatcha he built a fully functional email autoresponder which immediately became a prominent source of revenue and promoted customer retention. He has demonstrated his ability to work seamlessly on a foreign codebase with complex legacy code; leaving it better tested, commented, and refactored over time. Hou is a joy to work with. He is collaborative, patient, and has knack for solving difficult problems. He is a wealth of knowledge and proven maturity and would serve as a positive asset to any team! Henry Wong Software Engineer January 15, 2016, Henry worked with Hou in the same group Henry is one of the most talented engineers I know! The depth of his web development knowledge is impressive, and his ability to quickly pick up new languages and technologies has allowed him to become a highly productive engineer. He also has a knack for writing clean, modular code. His problem solving skills are excellent, and he is always very patient when explaining engineering concepts to other engineers. He is a joy to work with and will definitely be an asset to any engineering team. Sharmila Jesupaul Software Engineer, Front End December 12, 2015, Sharmila worked with Hou in the same group Sharmila is truly an asset to the engineering team. Her engineering skills are remarkable. I'm particularly impressed by her knack for solving difficult problems and her expertise in front-end technologies, especially in Angular (of which she has expert knowledge). For example, using Angular, she recently built a gift-builder feature that, over a period of one month, brought in a quarter million dollars of revenue for the company, and she continues to apply her skills to build features that are critical to the company's growth. She has also been taking the helm in debugging our very complex legacy codebase; Sharmila has helped us fix a large number of errors on our checkout page (that resulted from years of technical debt), which led to a significant decrease in the number of failed transactions just before the busy holiday season. On top of her impressive skills as an engineer, Sharmila is also a team player, an excellent communicator, and a passionate learner (as she's always learning new technologies and constantly pushing her skills to a new level). It's truly a delight to pair with her on projects. Her rare combination of technical prowess, high emotional intelligence, and patience makes her a pleasure to work with on a daily basis!

April 18, 2017, Jorge Fco. managed Efren directly I have come to know Efren since October of 2008 in the capacity of videogame artist, when I was the Associate Producer of CGBot.com There comes a time when you get to know someone that:- Is humble enough to teach and learn - Highlights the good things whenever bad things are happening- Has the leadership to encourage and bring the best of his teammates- Is part technical artist, programmer, and entrepreneur (You just can't beat that weird mix easily with specialists)You know you can trust to endure the tough process of creating something artistic with technology and scale it (Youtube channel with 145,000+ subscribers and all its content and promotion *Look for Inspector Geek in Youtube, original IP in a video game to reach tens of thousands *Trigger Runners for ios, android and PC via Steam.) Who is able to sacrifice his own comfy lifestyle in order to achieve an artistic vision either to tell a story or put a smile on someone's face.Efren has proved every single time we do a project with him an invaluable leader to take things further and to have a keen eye for details that usually get overlooked by common people without passion. His polishing of a vision sometimes might challenge the team's objectives related to economic goals. He’s different. He’s calm. He’s assertive and usually determined to make things happen. Without a doubt he has this kind of leadership where people follow not because he sells out loud what he’s doing but because they believe in his honesty and don't want to let him down because he tends to be -sometimes way too- kind. He has worked with our studio and community in co-productions, has been part of my team as an art lead for many console, mobile, and web games. He’s simply put one of the pillars and evangelists of our 5,400 members video game developer community at comunidad.karaokulta.com and without a doubt someone who differentiates by being able to gather and maintain a whole community that follows his work. There aren't that many leaders in the field of digital technology that keep on creating content related to his passions. Efren is one of those. Having met, worked and suffered together to make things happen with Efren is one of those highlights in my life that have helped me understand the position of a passionate creator while helping me out to fulfill my capitalist urge in creative industries. It’s an honor to fight for projects at his side; can’t wait to see what's up for him next and be part of it. Best.

He showed no fear to challenges, and he is always ready for new tasks. His bias to action is demonstrated throughout our time spent together on different projects.

Suárez Basáñez Co-Founder of KaraOKulta.com| KOGameStudios.com, GetSparkplug.com & every now and then I blog. April 18, 2017, Jorge Fco. managed Efren directly I have come to know Efren since October of 2008 in the capacity of videogame artist, when I was the Associate Producer of CGBot.com There comes a time when you get to know someone that:- Is humble enough to teach and learn - Highlights the good things whenever bad things are happening- Has the leadership to encourage and bring the best of his teammates- Is part technical artist, programmer, and entrepreneur (You just can't beat that weird mix easily with specialists)You know you can trust to endure the tough process of creating something artistic with technology and scale it (Youtube channel with 145,000+ subscribers and all its content and promotion *Look for Inspector Geek in Youtube, original IP in a video game to reach tens of thousands *Trigger Runners for ios, android and PC via Steam.) Who is able to sacrifice his own comfy lifestyle in order to achieve an artistic vision either to tell a story or put a smile on someone's face.Efren has proved every single time we do a project with him an invaluable leader to take things further and to have a keen eye for details that usually get overlooked by common people without passion. His polishing of a vision sometimes might challenge the team's objectives related to economic goals. He’s different. He’s calm. He’s assertive and usually determined to make things happen. Without a doubt he has this kind of leadership where people follow not because he sells out loud what he’s doing but because they believe in his honesty and don't want to let him down because he tends to be -sometimes way too- kind. He has worked with our studio and community in co-productions, has been part of my team as an art lead for many console, mobile, and web games. He’s simply put one of the pillars and evangelists of our 5,400 members video game developer community at comunidad.karaokulta.com and without a doubt someone who differentiates by being able to gather and maintain a whole community that follows his work. There aren't that many leaders in the field of digital technology that keep on creating content related to his passions. Efren is one of those. Having met, worked and suffered together to make things happen with Efren is one of those highlights in my life that have helped me understand the position of a passionate creator while helping me out to fulfill my capitalist urge in creative industries. It’s an honor to fight for projects at his side; can’t wait to see what's up for him next and be part of it. Best. Jorge SuarezCEO www.karaokulta.com / www.kogamestudios.com Abraham Lara Director en Coloso Studio November 10, 2016, Abraham managed Efren directly Efren is one of the most creative people I know with great capacity to undertake and manage projects.His career has led him to acquire multiple skills in various areas such as programming, systems and digital art.

Always worried about the projects and the quality of what the team was producing. Seeking different ways to develop his skills, being technical or interpersonal. Open to receive feedback and fast to respond to it. He invests time outside of work to learn new techniques and stay updated with the latest trends.I saw him leading teams technically and being led and he was always a great contributor to the projects and to the software development process, positioning him as a top performer. Teams trusted his judgement and followed his suggestions without any imposition. The projects were written in Ruby but we also had small apps written in Python, C# and ASP. He easily passed through these different programming languages.I'm very happy to recommend him and I hope that we can work together again in the near future.

Having never worked with SilverLining, I contacted Frank Kane at Sundog Software with a number of SilverLining SDK implementation questions. All of my requests for help were quickly addressed and his answers very accurately diagnosed my issues and resolved my problems. He really saved me a lot of time and effort. I've worked with a number of 3rd party vendors over the years and have rarely received the high level of support that Frank has provided. I highly recommend Frank. Len Granowetter Vice President, Products Division at MAK Technologies January 27, 2013, Len was a client of Frank’s Working with Frank has been a great experience. He has demonstrated deep expertise in 3D graphics and shader techniques; great judgement in trading off performance, flexibility, and implementation cost; terrific communication skills, and the rare ability to jump into an unfamiliar code base and start contributing value immediately. He's equally comfortable working with engineers on low-level technical details, and discussing top-level design and strategy with technical and business decision-makers. He's also a genuinely nice guy, who's been very easy to work with. I'd recommend Frank for just about anything.

Never before have I encountered an exercise that is both so simple and so profound in the actionable insights it gives you. Within just a few minutes, Jocelyn's process hit me with an "aha" moment like a ton of bricks. We're talking life-changing stuff, and you're hearing this from someone who approaches self-improvement exercises with deep skepticism. In my case, things that are deeply important to my own success were going unaddressed and even actively ignored - and I never even realized it. She's on to something that deserves to be shared more widely. Chen Blatman Business Development Manager at Udemy December 2, 2016, Frank was a client of Chen’s Chen's instincts on how to build the right product for the right people have been hugely valuable in shaping my career as a successful online instructor.
